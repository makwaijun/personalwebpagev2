  <article class="article mt-5">
    <p>Over the course of the last couple of years, and in part due to my time working in Singapore’s Economic Development Agency, I have since developed a fond interest in the economy/ field of economics.</p>
<p>In this context, I generalise and speak about the “economy” simply as anything related to the way value is exchanged. Going deeper, this topic touches on a wide range of concepts - economic history, firm competition, human behaviours, labour, government policies - all of which carry an incredible depth in their own right.</p>
<p>It was this depth that attracted me - particularly so at a time where there are many tensions and uncertainties. These are manifest in our daily news - churn in unemployment, the trade war, alternative currencies, new technologies, digitisation, and many more - all of which have a deep transformative impact on the way the economy works.</p>
<p>Curiosity in hand, what helped me along was also being equipped with the right tools to better understand a complex topic. For example, by looking at such topics through the lens of systems thinking while also trying to think systematically about intangible concepts.</p>
<p>However, I must concede that I have absolutely zero academic knowledge of (actual?) economics. Never took it in school, never touched it in University. I’ve heard of something regarding a supply and demand curve…?&hellip;uhh i’m afraid my understanding remains far too rudimentary.</p>
<p>That said, I suppose an outsider perspective is not necessarily a bad thing - it was clear during my work a that the field of economics is under siege. Within the more general push-back against “experts” in today’s trend, economists are also treated with distrust - particularly when things <em>don’t</em> work. If, in the past decades, the notion of “right” or “wrong” policies had already been rather grey, then surely none of it makes sense in today’s context.</p>
<p>This is demonstrated through two trends. First, that there are inexplicable surprises that no economist truly has been able to answer well - evident fact that there have been countless articles about the same damn thing (e.g. trade war and alternative currencies), with differing opinions, and a shit-show of a war zone in the comments box. Second, is the continued proliferation of KNOWN problems that are still getting worse - sustainability and inequality to name but two.</p>
<p>Given this, the following series of posts on economics aims to build on several governing themes that I have initially struggled to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why are some areas hot, and others not - even though the former doesn’t perceivably create value for society?</li>
<li>Why are some long standing issues, still issues?</li>
<li>What does the future economic structure hold?</li>
</ul>
<p>A skeleton on some of these themes were penned in my <a href="https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post13/">earlier post</a>, but has since been re-ordered for flow. Also, the timestamps for each of these are not quite accurate - this was recompiled at the end of May 2021.</p>
