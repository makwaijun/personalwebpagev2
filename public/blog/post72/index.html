*Afternote: gosh its been more than year between reading the book and actually posting this. *
On Character As remarked in the previous post on education I see the need to manage ourselves well (Life-led) as equally important to academics. This is something that cannot be directly “taught” in a school, but I believe it to be critically important as the world becomes ever more complex, uncertain and complicated.">

<h3 id="on-character">On Character</h3>
<p>As remarked in the previous <a href="https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post51/">post on education </a>I see the need to manage ourselves well (Life-led) as equally important to academics. This is something that cannot be directly &ldquo;taught&rdquo; in a school, but I believe it to be critically important as the world becomes ever more complex, uncertain and complicated.</p>
<p>As an extension of this line of thinking, I (not recently) read a book about character, which is a nice word to encapsulate all the relevant terms related to this topic: Call it integrity, values, self-mastery, discipline.</p>
<p>But in general (and indeed, the premise of the book), every &ldquo;great&rdquo; individual goes through journey, often with a non-lethal measure of hardship, shaping them into the mold of renown and &ldquo;greatness&rdquo;, though flawed in their own ways for sure.</p>
<p>But I am of the similar view that for every individual&rsquo;s rise to greatness, - there are just as many, or perhaps far more unwritten tales of a struggle with the very real human tedency to slide into matters of deprivation, self destruction and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia">akrasia</a>. To be clear, this is not an encouragement nor a worldview where I believe that <strong>everyone</strong> should aspire to &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory">greatness</a>&rdquo;, but rather an observation on what might have be done right that we mortals could learn from.</p>
<p><em>Crap my previous coherent draft ended here.</em></p>
<p>So, given that the book very much reflects on the growth of morality and meaning in a purposeful life, I have parked this as an interim post on education, in the context of how people can be enabled to achieve this in a non-lethal manner without too terrible a hardship.</p>
<p>Some related mental models I had penned down here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Adam I vs Adam II concept on our primal instincts vs a logical one. My view is that both must be groomed well</li>
<li>That tough times build tough people, and we must fight the overbearing protective instinct to inculcate the necessary trade-offs for thoughtful development.</li>
<li>Surrounded by good influences</li>
<li>Succession cannot be done alone. Perhaps its a mixture of personal (Adam I, emotional) investment, together with a rational, objective structure (Adam 2)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="on-succession">On Succession:</h4>
<p>In my earlier notes, I had contemplated the mystery of Succcession of Marcus Aurelius. For a great philosopher king as he - was he not able to groom a successor well?</p>
<p>Some questions come to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether character can be taught - though the answer, i suspect lies in between i) a tough time and ii) reflection</li>
<li>Inherent trade-offs around wanting the best for loved ones (</li>
<li>Trading-off with wanting the said loved one to like us as individuals (we&rsquo;re all softies aren&rsquo;t we)</li>
<li>How much and how close we take after our parents?</li>
</ul>
