    <p>Housekeeping: Defining &ldquo;Labour vs Career&rdquo;</p>
<p>This post continues to explore the interelation between the nature of work and human nature at a time when the notion of Work is being questioned.</p>
<p>I recognised that I&rsquo;ve embarked on two separate threads delving into the Philosophy of Work: One labelled &ldquo;Labour&rdquo; and one labelled &ldquo;Career&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As a broad framework, the series on Career will refer to guiding principles and frameworks that have helped me, as an individual assess and determine where to work;</p>
<p>On the other hand, Labour refers to the broader meaning of work and its relation to society - more of a philosophical inquiry if you will.</p>
<p>My usual guilty prvilege disclaimer: I feel that the context of this post will have tones of entitlement and choice - where i must acknowledge that in current times it is a privilege.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the precursor of this post was originally tagged as post 29. longg overdue.</p>
<h4 id="work-as-is-defined-by-the-commons">Work, as is defined by the Commons</h4>
<p>As this series delves a bit into the abstract, conceptual parts of what work is. We do the usual questioning:  What is Work? and when does work count as work?</p>
<p>If I took reality as a starting point,  what consitutes Work is pretty much built on a common definition defined by society and governments.
There are today, legal bases on what entails work following a spectrum of things touching on labour laws, corporate laws, etc. Definitions of employment matter: in practical terms, they directly determine what is broadly valued by society, and who qualifies for certain subsidies.</p>
<p>This common view however, has evolved massively over the course of human history - one which I will get more in a later post.  It wasn&rsquo;t always this way.
The form of work runs across spectrums of hierachy. (and I note that Humans have historically, very much been operating in hierachies). On one end, Slavery, Serfdom, Indentured Servitude were all common models in antiquity; and on the other hand, Employment contracts, and universal labour laws provide clearer boundaries of what is recognised today.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t inherently disagree with this defintion in principle (Obviously I live within this definition) - it is pragmatic, and pays the bills.</p>
<h4 id="work-as-defined-by-the-sunday-philosopher">Work, as defined by the Sunday Philosopher</h4>
<p>But to ponder over a Sunday afternoon (as one does), I must naturally open the philosophical can of worms and spend too much brainpower on my own definition.
And I think it is correct to question the current definition as the trends point towards a (more on that in a a later post.</p>
<p>There are examples that fall through the cracks:  hermits working for themselves (without the labour-power dynamic); or people being paid for things that don&rsquo;t contribute positively to society; and people contributing to society who don&rsquo;t get paid.</p>
<p>Personally, I loosely define work as some form of effort to survive that is valued and rewarded by society.</p>
<p>This very unscientific defintion comes from a point of view that while we are not starving as much as we used to; nor being chased by as many lions as our predecessors, I suppose there are segments of people that do not have to work to &ldquo;survive&rdquo;, and hence its important to not forget thsi part.</p>
<p>I lean towards some primal instincts:  and <a href="https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post15/">survivability</a> is as universal and biological a definition as it gets as an underlying motivator of work. Whether for self or for tribe, we work hard to see &ldquo;progress&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Moreover, and subject to the societal freedoms of its era, I would argue the pressure to survive and be instinctively entrepreneurial is the story of most of mankinds history. The snippets of mercantilism seen across history is very much a reflection of human creativity and ingenuity to achieve. Of course, there were many periods in history where the level of freedom did not permit this based on hierachy.</p>
<p>Based on this definition, being a stay at home mom for example, is work. This question is already a topical issue today that redefines the notion of being employed and generating GDP against what surely must be valued by society. I personally, am a proud product of that effort, although that effort is unrecognised by economists.</p>
<p>But it opens a large can of worms. Does being &ldquo;hot&rdquo;, and in pursuit of a Sugar Daddy or Sugar Mommy meet the definition? Probably yes: there is some form of effort or choice, in exchange for some form of contribution of value, albeit difficult to quantify and measure.</p>
<h4 id="facets-of-work-to-consider">Facets of work to consider</h4>
<p>As part of this series, that tackles the topic on a more philosophical perspective;</p>
<p>Who do we work for?
<em>The self, the person, the family, the company, the society</em></p>
<p>What do we work for?
*Material and after needs are met, fulfilment. *</p>
