  <article class="article mt-5">
    <p>As a self-identified generalist, I often think about the use and meaning of considering specialisation.</p>
<p>Its also a topic that has come up several times with my peers - many of whom are generalists too, by virtue of starting my career in a primarily general area. I&rsquo;ve noticed that this critical decision (<a href="https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post85/">binarity of choices</a>), suffers from the Grass-is-greener on the otherside complex.</p>
<p>The Generalist feels insecure and the lack of definition on the value of their skills and their transferability.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Specialist feels insecure at the lack of other experinces, and being trapped in their discipline.</p>
<p>No right or wrong in these situations, but what has helped me to choose a side it through understanding my own dispositions.</p>
<p>For instance, my identity as a highly curious individual about most things has aligned quite well with going down the Generalist pathways - for better or for worse.</p>
<h3 id="pathways">Pathways</h3>
<p>The next question then, is how these principles can be applied especially for generalists.</p>
<p>Specialists on the other hand seem to have it easier - just be really good at the one thing you do, and hope that it is commensurately value to the market too.</p>
<p>Often, I have seen my generalist peers take up roles in Business Development. Probably apt - as I&rsquo;ve ended up in similar roles and can see where the curiosity and generalist skillsets can come very handy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also learned and indeed experinced the value of developing one&rsquo;s own network and connections. I hope to never have to be a faceless individual  on an electronic resume - skipping the nonsense and being referred in instead.</p>
<p>There are some roles that necessitates generalism in its full sense - General managers, for example, will need a blend of multiple skills, all rolled into one.
But a comment from someone I shared this with raises an excellent question: It is then, difficult for an (externmely) introverted generalist to thrive or exist? I&rsquo;m not sure - but despite being fairly introverted, theres clearly and element of being really easy to work with that has seemed to persist across my career.</p>
<p>I think the eventual goal is to funnel innate curiosity into networks and experience.</p>
<p>A good read on this was . I think its relevant to the above&hellip; although I can barely remember any of my main takeaways.</p>
