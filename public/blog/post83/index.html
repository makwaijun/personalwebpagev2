The 2022 Covid Experience In the lead up to it, I was perpetually feeling under the weather for sometime - largely due to unhealthy work environment triggering a chronic state of childhood allergic reactions.
And it twas a grave November 8th as I returned from work on a dreary Tuesday evening. My cold-Like symptoms rapidly deteriorated at work that afternoon. Nose turned on. Like a tap unfortunately.">

<h3 id="the-2022-covid-experience">The 2022 Covid Experience</h3>
<p>In the lead up to it, I was perpetually feeling under the weather for sometime - largely due to unhealthy work environment triggering a chronic state of childhood allergic reactions.</p>
<p>And it twas a grave November 8th as I returned from work on a dreary Tuesday evening. My cold-Like symptoms rapidly deteriorated at work that afternoon. Nose turned on. Like a tap unfortunately.</p>
<p>Tuesday - return from work. Already knew I was going down and that it was viral. Bought 2 x redoxon packs, inhalers, 38.3 C. Left nose super stuffy</p>
<p>Wednesday - morning temp 38. Right nose super stuffy. (I continue to be amazed at the human body&rsquo;s ability to keep one nostril open.</p>
<p>Post - fever, things were generally tiring, though I focused heavily on recovering and not being too active.
In fact, I had caught a sinus infection one week after being covid. Though largely attributable to me not being too diligent in recovery. As I write this, full, perfectly asymptomatic recovery is still underway.</p>
<p>Some persistent symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Runny nose (2 weeks after negative)</li>
<li>Mucus and a terribly stubbonrly congested sinus (persistent one month&hellip;and onwards). After some experimentation, I find that my childhood allergies and triggers are more acutely sensitive than before.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reflective-thoguhts">Reflective thoguhts:</h3>
<p>There was something about the feeling of knowing and labelling one&rsquo;s illness as Covid. It was a universal pass for sympathy. A unifying experience. Of high expectations of a known illness. Easily able for others to empathise, while having a globally backed narrative on its potential severity and danger (which diminished, in practice over time). Oddly comforting because you know exactly what it is.</p>
<h3 id="a-laypersons-thesis-on-covid">A layperson&rsquo;s thesis on COVID:</h3>
<p>From a practical persepctive, I reason that Covid is everywhere. Its on me, on you, and all over the place with high human density.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s uniqueness is how it&rsquo;s given an opportunity to infect, multiply and shed. Just like any parasite.
Its a virus waiting for immune system to drop, and exploit the body. So, the most impactful thing is to keep our immune systems robust and tough. (I&rsquo;m reminded that Vit D, C and Zinc are key Vits to ensure good levels).</p>
<p>From a future perspective, to understand the trajectory of COVID (and possibly other pandemics in the future), I rather like a consistent mental model to approach it. Most of all, a thought around steady states and darwinian evolution.</p>
<p>I posit that the virus inherently wants propagation. If true, propagation and reproduction dictates higher transmissibility and thus lower fatality.</p>
<p>So I believe it will hold true in China (entering an immense wave of infections as of the time of writing), and hence even though there are concerns over new mutations, I don&rsquo;t believe it will significantly endanger the world.</p>
<p>In reality, COVID has since left the realms of medical science, and instead is a topical narrative of cyclical domestic and geo-politics.</p>
<p>Anyway, mankind lives to survives another pandemic and life goes on&hellip;.</p>
