            Another year, another In Camp Training (Singapore reservist shenanigans). My 9th year of ICT (how time flies), and the 7th cycle in the &ldquo;syllabus&rdquo;
It was different this time.
In the preceding year, I was focused on understanding, applying and trialing different observations from various leaders and managers. In particular, I was taken to the concept of Servant Leadership: which I layer on a fundamental belief that humans do desire to be productive; and if well directed, may miss their target due to 3 fundamental factors: resourcing, competency, and bottlenecks and decisions. The assumption here is that the targets and strategy are well set.

            I was introduced to Agency as an idea. This was well explained in the article. A fun read, accompanied by memes and graphic accompaniments.
Its a concept that acts well as an intermediary between the idealist notion of absolute freedom, and the practicalities of life.
For we can&rsquo;t control everything, nor can we find perfection in maximising anything. But preserving a degree of element of choice and control within the world&rsquo;s constraints is something that i find is:

            Likely written around 3 June (while somewhere in Italy)
This post was inspired by an article i read, published in early March 2025.
There was an elegance (Simple principles, ugh, so gooood) in two fundamental, and somewhat opposing needs of 1) Connection and 2) Autonomy
&ldquo;These needs reflect two key goals our distant ancestors had to achieve: to bond with others for their mutual protection, and to develop personal skills to make them valuable to their group and potential mates. In service of these goals, our ancestors evolved two corresponding needs that still drive us today: from childhood through to old age, humans have a need for connection and a need for autonomy. &quot;

            This is a compilation of word snippets and musings, while on the trip.
On the Highways from Milanpensa Adolation of symmetry
Man belongs in nature Wrapped by sheet cliffs of green. Columns of broad shouldered Europeans Mountainous like the ranges Paths cycling
A love of the outdoors Hiking, biking But man too needs to suffer, Straining up steep roads Braving the elements
The artifice of putting ourselves in nature, and the artifice of our self made constraints of modernity

I remember when this website was born out of a feeling of a loss of control. Or a sense of helplessness that is felt during a once-in-a-lifetime (hoepfully) pandemic.
Change is an ever constant, and writing this when I have finally caught a berak overlooking what i believe to the be the Alps between Italy and Austria comes at a time when the human mind, my mind, is equally at risk of imploding in the too many

            Rediscovering Belle Epoque, and the link and connection with a nice game i&rsquo;ve picked up recently (Clair Obscur, expedition 33).
A wistful being overcomes me. The philosopher. The Poet. Not the warrior, today.
I listen to Tosti, which wikipedia says is representative of Salon Music. I read about the lineage of English kings. The rabbit hole brings be from Orleans (not far from where Caesar won the battle of Alesia), the hundred year&rsquo;s war; the black death, from Edward III to Elizabeth I. The franco-prussian war (preceding the belle epoque), and its note about the evolution of general staff.

            I pick up this smattering of notes, on the back of finishing of a macro view of the evolving world order. What next but to write about a place a bit closer to home?
A topic that still has a lingering interest, having worked in a government agency and all; and a continuation of where I last left off.
Since then, I&rsquo;ve written fairly broadly, especially around my interests in Universal Frameworks and principled views on seemingly complex or abstract topics.

            The spark for this post was the election of President Trump to his second term, and the minor rah rah of emotions that goes along with it. In content and outlook, it mirrors a time when I became a slightly more politically attuned graduate (2016), but more or less felt nothing in this second term. For structural issues remain issues, and change is (I suppose I am now 7 years wiser), acceptably constant.

            Generally, I&rsquo;ve found that accounting is not biblical scriptures, but its principles needs to be aligned. Most accounting practices can be fairly standard, but some that perhaps require more thought (based on past experience) are:
Cost of Goods - what goes into it, what doesnt (especially on material and manhours, and on unit costs) R&amp;D Capitalisation - Unclear if capitalising too much is a good thing in the long run. There needs to be clarity on actual numbers as opposed to hiding. More broadly expenses vs capitalisation Inventory management and accounting Amortisation duration (Placeholder for future) Rough Notes Taken from super raw notes from an SME accounting Course. May not be wholly accurate, but hey, I&rsquo;m not an accountant, and just need to know the minimum
