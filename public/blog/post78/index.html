I remember it vividly. I remember it well.
It was a gray morning. I remember it as a hefty sense of morning tiredness - Bleary eyed, I had gotten off the bus, sauntering towards work. There was a long day ahead of a visit programme with a client, and much to do and be mindful of. I was distant and inattentive. I noticed a few policeman, presumably temporarily detaining and discussing around a person. Inconsequential really.">

  <article class="article mt-5">
    <p>This post will be a story; and a story of a young man&rsquo;s internal conflict. On Accidental heroism, and the vanity of it all.</p>
<p>I remember it vividly. I remember it well.</p>
<p>It was a gray morning. I remember it as a hefty sense of morning tiredness - Bleary eyed, I had gotten off the bus, sauntering towards work. There was a long day ahead of a visit programme with a client, and much to do and be mindful of. I was distant and inattentive. I noticed a few policeman, presumably temporarily detaining and discussing around a person. Inconsequential really.</p>
<p>Untill the person in question makes a break from it. I describe the ordeal as bizarre, amongst most things.</p>
<p>In slow motion, I saw him making a beeline in my direction - clearly this guy was a on the run. And it was in that instant that it felt - almost like a chore. A sequence of events that played out a scenario, like a storyboard of a comic strip.</p>
<p>And it was the strangest of feelings.</p>
<p>I dropped my bag, without undue action, but with a slight amount of patient care, knowing there was a laptop in it.</p>
<p>I lowered my centre of gravity and stuck out my arms wide. Zero thought. Just instinct. By this stage, I could see the features of the man. Wide-eyed and ready to break, a true rabid flight or fight reaction.</p>
<p>In the next second, the thought kicked in - do I tackle high or low? Around this moment, and officer had noticed and in similar slow motion, started to chase, albeit it clumsily with a large helmet on - there was no way he could have outpaced this lightfooted man to be honest.</p>
<p>As we entered the critical moment, the persons attempts to cut in through my right. But wide open arms made for a good net, and we both fell - heavily-  onto the pavement under the awning. I was on my back and I remember my glasses flying off a considerable distance and clutching him without a single thought in my head. I&rsquo;d acknowledge the sharp elbows cutting into my ribs however, and the heaviness of a body on my chest.</p>
<p>Soon after the police came, prying him off and leading them to do their own struggles.</p>
<p>What happened next was one of the most surreal moments of my life. Once sufficiently clear. I stood up, dusted myself off, while a pedestrian somewhat feebly tried to pass me my glasses. I picked up my bag, and walked off, avoiding all eye contact; all attention.</p>
<p>All I had to show for it was a scuff and dirt marks on my G2000 shirt, a few grazes on my ribs and the bruises on my back from the impact.
There was no fear, just had to do the right thing.</p>
<p>But the short walk to the office was such a complex mix of feelings.
I felt embarrassed? For doing something so prominent
I felt worried about work, for this was not the way to start a long day ahead (and wanting to look clean and professional)
and then I felt&hellip;upset&hellip;that no one knew who I was and what I had done.</p>
<p>I went about the day as I did, and attended the full work day&rsquo;s events as I had to.</p>
<p>But it served as a data point for introspection. I behaved - immediately - according to my values.  I believe that this was a rare, true test of courage and character to do the &ldquo;right&rdquo; thing.</p>
<p>But then my ego and vanity crept in. I was certain it was the &ldquo;right&rdquo; thing to do, but for whom and for what? For society?  I was left feeling frustrated at being unrecognised.  That my name could appear in the headlines for a good civilian deed; a pat on the back from the policeman on duty.</p>
<p>All in all, I feel almost a sense of shame; of the extent to which I was uncomfortable of having let this opportunity for glory slip by me. My shame in my selfishness makes it difficult to be proud and content - as I want to feel - that I did the right thing.</p>
<p>Recalling this story, four and a half years later stirs up some of these conflicted feelings.. I feel heroic, but crave the vanity that deeply contradicts my general values of being under the radar and avoiding the public eye. In a strange way I felt i had to &ldquo;confess&rdquo; my heroic acts to a few close family members and friends.
At least the incident has been immortalised on a Stomp post on Stamford road and sometimes consider if it is safe to make such a connection in a public domain.
The shame of craving recognition feels too great, casting a pall on something good. One of the many facets of an inexplainable and contradictory human psyche.</p>
