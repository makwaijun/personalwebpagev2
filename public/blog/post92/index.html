    <p><em>This was written on a return plane ride from a Hong Kong work trip to Singapore around 10 Feb 2023.</em></p>
<p>A philosophical post as a I find myself, tired, occupied and worried over numerous journeys in the last week. Being out of one&rsquo;s homeland, being out of one&rsquo;s comfort zone, being forced to deliver and achieve (but by whom - is yet another philosophical question).</p>
<p>This post was spurred once again by my good friend, my best friend. Who in the path of solace, had begun to unravel the mysteries of the self.</p>
<p>Interesting yet impactful. For we often judge and assess the virtue of self-awareness. And yet, t inquire into the self, can too easily be a boundless abyss of though. Better suited for the ramblings of a free-flowing mind, in a stupor of stress or alcohol, than it is an academic, well thought out piece.</p>
<h3 id="belief">Belief</h3>
<p>We observed that the understanding of Self begins a sense of belief. Of truths that one holds, of opinions one feels.</p>
<p>Some can be created by others. Some can be created by gods created by others.</p>
<p>Who are we, but vessels of our own thoughts, and actions in the mere split second of time in the existence of the universe?</p>
<p>And so indeed, the focus and pursuit of my own truths (as documented in this blog) can be seen as an accidental step into developing my own self. I am enriched by the clarity of some of my thinking  - not because they are loosely held opinions or factoids, but because they are grounded in my own soul as things I&rsquo;ll feel intensely strongly about, and can truly call my own.</p>
<p>Even if some of these may not be original - I am sure that something, someone out there had,can and will type out the same concepts word for word. I take ownership of my own thoughts because they were created by me. Not inherited.</p>
<p>Though we often stand on the shoulders of giants, and take humility in it - it is equally the trap of imposter syndrome that destroys the ability to nurture said Sense of Self.</p>
<h3 id="being-one-with-oneself">Being one with oneself</h3>
<p>But i reflect that the construction of self has to start somewhere. As a start, many people in the world may not be self aware to begin with, and that in its own right takes time, cultivation if its ever even achieved.</p>
<p>Others, like myself I find, am disposed to find time by myself, thus, understanding over time, my desires, my triggers, my joys, my pains. To strive towards being in check and in control, where possible.</p>
<h3 id="mastering-oneself">Mastering oneself</h3>
<p>Being in control of onself is an inhuman phenomena I would think. I still think humans are animals to a large degree. We&rsquo;re primed for emotional and survival responses, which grates against the need for selfcontrol.</p>
<p>In response, we apply and figure out ways to manage our emotions, push our strengths and accept our weaknesses. The discipline which I would loosely wrap around mental-health offers all kinds of tips and tricks to process such things.</p>
<p>But these tools and systems for repeatability demands logic, and logic demands objectivity. When applied enough times, one begins to separate from oneself. We peer into our minds like a therapist; we take a look at ourselves through a mirror; we console ourselves as a friend. I&rsquo;ve observed that the abstraction of ourselves from our-self results in a higher degree of control.</p>
<p>And it is at that moment that we develop a core sense of self-belief. Blessing us with the ability to tell ourselves what to do.</p>
<p>The end result is us not only being a friend of our own , but being the master, the puppeteer, and ultimately the controller of self and destiny.</p>
<p>Self mastery requires self awareness, self diagnosis, self direction, and I hope that one day, I will attain the self-assuredness, the peace to exist in an ever changing world. (link post to peace)</p>
<h3 id="dispositions-towards-sense-of-self">Dispositions towards Sense of self</h3>
<p>Inherent traits that enabled me to <em>find myself</em> (ugh so cringe saying &ldquo;find myself&rdquo;).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there ever is a clear recipe to develop this. Every person is unique. But there are some elements that, upon looking back, have nudged me into this direction.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a very individual person, and being a introvert helps, I suppose. I am comfortable spending time with myself;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hardwired to survive - makes sense biologically, I don&rsquo;t get people who are too carefree;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ive had little socio-culutral norms: Never had a relgion, never had a strong national identity - so I just define what makes sense to me, by myself, for myself;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m disposed to the utilitarian and stoic philosophy to suffer. Buddhism too. I, in understanding myself, know that my mind likes to suffer and worry. I&rsquo;ve accepted that. So i don&rsquo;t avoid suffering. I try to control it. Simply put, I try my best to control myself, in whatever environment I&rsquo;m thrown into.</p>
</li>
</ul>
