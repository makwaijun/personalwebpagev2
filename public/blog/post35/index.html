PREMISE 1: GLOBAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CAN BE BROKEN DOWN INTO SEMI-DISCRETE SEGMENTS On one hand, the global economy is an enigmatic force.
It is constantly reshaping - creating and destroying wealth, lives and countries. Yet, when looked at from a historical perspective and if abstracted to a high-enough level, patterns also emerge.

<h3 id="premise-1--global-economic-development-can-be-broken-down-into-semi-discrete-segments"><strong>PREMISE 1:  GLOBAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CAN BE BROKEN DOWN INTO SEMI-DISCRETE SEGMENTS</strong></h3>
<p>On one hand, the global economy is an enigmatic force.</p>
<p>It is constantly reshaping - creating and destroying wealth, lives and countries. Yet, when looked at from a historical perspective and if abstracted to a high-enough level, patterns also emerge. Therefore this first Premise supposes that the global economy has evolved (constantly changing) over long periods of time through certain somewhat-discrete eras - defined here as “chapters”.</p>
<p>This approach builds on my initial plan to think critically with the<a href="https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post27/"> assistance of history</a>. Though viewing<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostow's_stages_of_growth"> economic development* through eras is not new</a>, the abstractions to the global level and the observations of each are hopefully novel, in this post and others.</p>
<p><em>Although &ldquo;Economic Development&rdquo; is often used in the context of countries, this framework takes the bigger-picture approach to understand how the global economy evolved across time and countries. This takes the perspective of human civilisation in its</em> <em>entirety</em>*, rather than that of select communities.*</p>
<h3 id="chapters-can-be-defined-through-its-dominant-economic-activity">Chapters can be defined through its dominant economic activity.</h3>
<p>As described, I believe that, when abstracted to a high-enough level, patterns can emerge. This paves the way to cluster certain periods of time into a segment. Within this, I define each chapter by the predominant economic activity of its time.</p>
<p>The characteristics of this activity are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Strong economic profitability,</strong> as organisations are able to differentiate themselves and out-compete due to the above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>High investment</strong>, resources, investment and effort flow towards the predominant economic activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>High job creation potential</strong>, both in terms of quantity and quality. In other words, there are new ways to create value for society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Socio-economic premium</strong>, as individuals working in these sectors do comparatively well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Emergence of specialised hubs</strong>, as agglomerations of assets and people working in these sectors outperform other locations.</p>
<p>on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All points are in <strong>relative</strong> terms, meaning that multiple economic activities can co-exist - just that one is better than another. These points also capture a key concept underpinning this framework - <strong>Differentiation</strong>.</p>
<p>&lt; as a reminder to self: Points 5 and 6 breeds domestic inequality and international inequality, for the future post&gt;</p>
<h3 id="there-are-seven--principle-economic-activities-that-have-come-to-define-each-chapter">There are Seven  Principle Economic Activities that have come to Define each Chapter</h3>
<p>Applying the characteristics above, I suppose that the global economy has been evolved through the following chapters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumption</li>
<li>Resource Development</li>
<li>Manufacturing and Craftsmanship</li>
<li>Global Trade</li>
<li>Modern Services</li>
<li>Digitalisation</li>
<li>Platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>I am aware of the recency bias for some of these chapters (platforms for example), but I believe they have been profoundly impactful to justify their inclusion into the list. Otherwise, just as this post explained the discrete/consistent patterns observed to <em>define</em> chapters, the next post adds on a further layer of commentary onto each of these.This more or less ends this post by summarising the principles of defining each chapter, but for a lengthier exposition of each of these chapters, please read on.</p>
