    <p>I&rsquo;ve been into this field for a while. studied in 2016. now worked and wokring for two climate hardware technology startups.</p>
<p>Perhaps, for a topic so deeply rooted in noise, change and transition, its worth relooking each year to see how my views have (or have not) changed.</p>
<h3 id="what-has-maintained">What has Maintained</h3>
<h4 id="an-anti-catastrophic-mindset">An Anti-catastrophic mindset</h4>
<p>I dont deny the issues, climate change is real, but I continue to maintain an antagonistic view against angsty activitists and doomsayers. Generally a lack of proper advocacy and inability to understand the <a href="https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post88/">trade offs</a> hinders meaningful actions. Lots of loud noises, but unproductive.</p>
<p>The book &ldquo;Factfulness&rdquo; comes to mind - to recognise that quality of life has improved immensely over time. But this is a trade off, pollution, energy vs many things and quality of life they enjoy.</p>
<h4 id="the-anti-advocacy-angst">The anti-advocacy angst</h4>
<p>There also continues to be a huge hypocrisy at the systemic level too - that the materially rich ones are often the ones who are also the most &ldquo;upset&rdquo;. The overall point being that those who shout the loudest are often the ones who had never done the work.</p>
<p>They have never seen how energy is generated, and immeasurable benefits it has brought to society; never seen how modern agriculture has put food on the table.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take an educated guess and suggest that in &ldquo;those&rdquo; sort of sustainability communities, the make up of technicians and farmers are low. How many are students? How many are workers in marketing /PR; and what is the real proportion of people who are developing a meaningful product to change things?</p>
<p>I would exhaust myself, trying to reiterate where I think the real needle movers might be:</p>
<p>While there are more green &ldquo;products&rdquo; coming onto the market, I still feel the whole industry around accounting, services, software and consulting are enablers, but not quite &ldquo;doers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Who are the doers?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The man installing solar panels, on a hot day in a hi-vis vest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scientist, tinkering on new materials and manufacturing technologies to achieve the next berakthrough (sodium ion batteries has been quite exciting in 2023)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The engineer designing new boats, cars, planes and power plants</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Electrical grid upgrades</p>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>And making all of the above, as accessible, cheap and safe as possible.</p>
<h4 id="a-commentary-in-defence-of-plastics">A commentary in defence of plastics</h4>
<p>This is a world deeply reliant on plastics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be interesting to see the esecond order effects strongly regulated such that plastics become uncompetitive (and with it, diesel, etc); and how it will shape markets in the absence of good alternatives. After all, many products come from the same feed stock.</p>
<p>Failing which - many aspects - Food and beverage, medical care and much more will be upended with new models.</p>
<p>I think cost, hygiene and convenience are all hugely beneficial features that plastics have: and cannot be taken for granted.</p>
<p>The disposability of plastic in regions of poor infrastructure is a match made in heaven - what happens next?
In a perfect world, all governments would agree on a fixed timeline for a phase out. But the world is not fair - and different countries will be impacted at different costs.  No country will be a pioneer in sacrificng their citizens and economy for the world.</p>
<h4 id="the-ultimate-premium-of-sustainable">The Ultimate Premium of Sustainable</h4>
<p>Something has to give - and we are caught in a complex web and loop of trade-off, suffering and unpopular political choices. There will be a price that people will soon need to pay.</p>
<p>Higher costs of clean energy; the reactivation of Coal power plants,  under times of great energy insecurity;  There is no easy way to quantify off-peak costs. A cost of baseload power shouldn&rsquo;t ever directly be compared to the cost of direct electric renewable energy. Are we on the way to building fully clean and resilient grids?</p>
<p>Controlling excess by whom and for what: can markets and the economy will then need to adjust to low growth and  perhaps with it - comes savings, prudence and generally, less use?</p>
<h3 id="what-has-changed-what-ive-learnt">What has changed, What Ive learnt</h3>
<p><em>From climate mitigation to climate adaptability</em></p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say this is a major change, but perhaps leaning towards a confirmation of what I&rsquo;ve felt for a long time.</p>
<p>We are likely seeing climate issues today that are a result from emissions that came out many years ago. Systems take time to stabilise and adapt to shocks, and a lag period exists. That said, I am not sure how many years it will take for X amount of carbon emissions to lead to Y amount of drastic events or increase in temperature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear to me that there will be more extreme weather patterns and events in the coming years.
Efforts to mitigate climate change (i.e. decarbonise) is useful and should remain. But I believe adaptation will soon be very key.</p>
<p><em>On Azollas and the not-so catastrophic outcome</em></p>
<p>Somehow came across this on an online video. It resonated strongly with my interest in Steady states. It&rsquo;s not be about the near term path we are on, but whats the end destination thats worth consdering to plan towards.</p>
<p>As it turns out, as we,  a speck of dust in the greater cosmos, are still within an &ldquo;ice age&rdquo; period. To think that. It contextualises things too - that we&rsquo;ve thrived in an anomalous period, and we are returning in some ways (no doubt caused by us) to the way things should be.</p>
<p>Reading about the hypothesised Azolla event and Paleoclimatology were both super interesting - in suggesting what earth is &ldquo;normally&rdquo; like.</p>
<p>To bring in the modern discussion on fossil fuels: if all our oil were azollas, being released back into the atmosphere - wouldnt this point towards a return to the temperature of XX? Is the question soon to be - how best to survive and thrive in such climates?
It is a place mind you, filled with lush greenery, towering trees&hellip;and lots of reptiles. Less a favourable to mammals. But Homo Sapiens have been quite resilient havent we?</p>
<p>It is hardly the image of desolation and dust filled imagery of a planet undergoing heat torture. And certainly, a setting for yet another story of human resilience to be written there too.</p>
