    <h3 id="preamble">Preamble</h3>
<p>First of all, I am in a blessed position where I do not have to obsess about finances (the most relevant goal of work). Instead, I explore the more indulgent aspects of work, assuming we are able to put enough food on the table and live well. This is made possible with limited liabilities and a stable background, which I must remind myself not to take for granted.</p>
<p>This series pens down my personal thinking behind work and its meaning - to act as an mental anchor to be deliberate, wise and free to make sound choices in this impactful area of life. It is as much a doctrine for career planning; as much as it is a balm for my soul, easily lost in a sea of choices.</p>
<h3 id="specialisation-has-married-work-to-purpose">Specialisation has married Work to Purpose</h3>
<p>Like many of my others posts, I like to use my historical guesstimation as a reference point. It sets the context, and to appreciate what how the world has changed over time. I remain humbled by the advances of civilisation, and to not take things for granted.</p>
<p>The relationship between work and humans have evolved over time. Man was focused on hunting, and foraging for litereal survival during the dawn of civilisation. As with nature&rsquo;s laws, living beings lived to work, and lived long enough to make life. There was, as long as mother nature allowed for, downtime and a commonality across small tribes. Time was largely spent eating, sleeping and living.</p>
<p>But a radical development changed all this as humans evolved not only as individuals, but as a collective - the emergence of different types of work/labour, and the specialisation of roles. Aside from the social impact (Which I have written about to a certain degree) - work became interrelated with our individual identities and greater purpose in life.</p>
<h3 id="the-system---a-modern-narrative-on-work-choice-vs-entrapment">&ldquo;The System&rdquo; - a Modern Narrative on Work: Choice vs Entrapment</h3>
<p>Modern society offers more options in work than ever before. The number of &ldquo;specialisations&rdquo; has exploded exponentially, in an age where one could be a i) digital ii) marketer selling iii) fruit juice to a iv) young audience. But the ills of modern society has created a narrative that leaves many trapped in an age of objective freedom. Humans are no longer shackled by our survival needs; but are instead shackled by our desire for purpose. Do we work to live? or live to work?</p>
<p>Along with some <a href="https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post52/">systemic issues in the world</a>, I often see a dichotomous view of being &ldquo;with the (capitalist) system&rdquo; or against it. <em>Digital nomads</em> today and the <em>hippie subculture</em> of the 1960s are what I view as examples of those against the system. It stems from a broader push-back; an anti-establishment counterculture that is derived from an inherent disatisfaction with said &ldquo;system&rdquo;. Today, I also observe a broader trend in advanced societies figthing the glamourisation of work, as much as this culture of overwork initself was a human construct in the decades prior (I suppose it could relate to a societal spree of &ldquo;rebuilding&rdquo; after the post-war era and strife, but I&rsquo;m sure there are better thought out theories on this by academics).</p>
<p>This is especially so in cultures seemingly entrapped in the rat race of modern society. Some call it &ldquo;corporate enslavement&rdquo;, bound by the illusion of choice of an ever-increasing array of career options; but mentally stuck in the rut of expectations, norms, lifestyle creep and more, etc.</p>
<p>So, having set the context on the nature of work, and the narrative of work - the next posts would investigate a little more into my intepretation, and what it means for me.</p>
