    <p>Semi-obligatory, but nonetheless important to just privately . As I type this, I am currently in between an old job and new one, carving out a momentary pause for reflection. &hellip;and weakly attempting to clear 19 blog posts in the backlog. Trying out <a href="https://www.zettlr.com/">Zettlr</a> instea of Typora, as the latter has launched with a subscription fee. Moving forward, I will label the post number in the header… technically this is my 43rd file, but it seems that my numbering had missed a chunk of post 20-somethings and its gone a bit off the rails. Oh well.</p>
<p>As part of this process, I must pedantically state that 2021 was a trying year, with a new job, launched a wine company, trialled moving out yadda yadda. COVID continued, etc. Yes, very much part of the broader public headlines around the great resignation; mental health; inflated property market.</p>
<p><strong>Gratititude</strong>
And yet as trying as the world may be, it is important to constantly remind oneself of the true picture of adversity and challenges.
Many of my issues, and indeed that within Singapore, can be contextualised against whats happening elsewhere in the world and in history.</p>
<p>At this reflective moment, From this experience (and the distinctive lack of regret in the face of challenges), I&rsquo;d add two additional frameworks to this life toolkit.</p>
<h4 id="life-compass-recalibration---scratching-the-itch">Life Compass Recalibration - &ldquo;Scratching the itch&rdquo;</h4>
<p>The first is &ldquo;Scratching the itch&rdquo;:
2021 marked a <em>sizeable</em> (empahsised by others, which I can see how it is so now) jump from a government job into a small startup (employee 6ish).</p>
<p>I must share the thought process on why I changed jobs in the first place.</p>
<p>First - I recognise a rather emotional and unsatiated curiosity in my current role. Can be partially attributed to churn, Working from Home during COVID, etc. Comes at that age I suppose, when you&rsquo;re a few years into the first job. Fairly common, amongst white collar graduates where we all think we&rsquo;re hot (fustrated) shit.</p>
<p>Second - a calculated and directed intent towards three experiences I wanted to grow from:
i) A small company (to maximise learning)
ii) Sustainability oriented (for both reasons of it being &ldquo;trendy&rdquo; and hence where capital flows to, which <a href="https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post35/">I have written about before</a>, backed up by the fact that I&rsquo;ve studied it in 2016)
iii) Hardware company. (Because<a href="https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post42/"> intangible products have a higher risk of it being a bullshit job/industry</a>)</p>
<p>So with this chapter partially closed (switching jobs again..), I look back and reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was it tough? yes.</li>
<li>Were there unexpected surprises? Too many to count (probably ought to write this down somewhere too)</li>
<li>Do I regret it? Absolutely not.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so, with an interim measure success, I look back at the bigger picture and reason that if there are big itches, it is important to plan how to scratch it, scratch that itch and &ldquo;move on&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Gut feel: disatisfied + Bold,calculcated move = freer mental space in the future, less angst =  :)</p>
<p>The result is the ability to mentally free up mental energy otherwise spent on speculation and &ldquo;what if&rdquo; questions to more productive outlets. It has improved my sense of what I like or don&rsquo;t like, and I believe I&rsquo;d be fine returning to jobs or roles that i&rsquo;ve had in the past, having settled the fustration/ curiosityity that clawed at my inner being for many a day in my previous jobs.</p>
<p>Having now experienced working in a startup, MNCs and government - I am less &ldquo;itchy&rdquo; in terms of career aspirations than before.</p>
<p>Caveat - I am able to take such moves due to the rest of my Mazlowe&rsquo;s hierachy being in order. Roof over the head, food on the table etc. I must always acknowledge this.</p>
<h4 id="life-compass-recalibration---three-concrete-blocks">Life Compass Recalibration - &ldquo;Three Concrete Blocks&rdquo;</h4>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your new year&rsquo;s resolution??&rdquo; is a question that I both love and hate at the same time. I deeply enjoy (as the words flow from my fingertips) the exercise of introspective reflection, direction and structure. On the other hand, poring over lists and then seeing whether you had &ldquo;progressed&rdquo; or not, is an exercise in tedium and the battle against <em>akrasia</em> which I don&rsquo;t think many normal human beings will win. And I&rsquo;m as fallible and flawed as they come.</p>
<p>I had <a href="https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post26/">earlier written in 2021 of some of the goals I wanted to accomplish</a>, but perhaps this point specifically addresses the need for the sound execution of ideas. <strong>Ideas are commoditised</strong>, I was focussed on turning them into reality in 2021.</p>
<p>The best example in 2021 was an action I took that stemmed from a very high level intent, but avoided the need for much, if at all, deep planning (daunting):</p>
<ul>
<li>Goal: I wanted to /learn dabble into entrepreneurship</li>
<li>Concrete Action: Incorporate a company (for what? For who? I had no clue at that point)</li>
<li>Outcome: Launched a wine trading company (<a href="https://vinearth.com/">check it out</a>!)</li>
</ul>
<p>The action alone (and nominal sums of money invested in its incorporation) was enough of a first step in (otherwise scary) new grounds that allowed me to think through and eventually launch a business on the side.</p>
<p>I never really had a name for this until I am typing it out now, (started with three big rocks) but I think this label is apt.</p>
<p><em>Three</em> suggests a narrowing down and clear prioritisation (coz I still need my own time to lie in bed watching youtube)
<em>Concrete Blocks</em> connotes a sense of clear action, and indeed &ldquo;foundational&rdquo; for more things to come from it. Like..a building- concrete foundations? Geddit?</p>
<h4 id="2022---big-concrete-blocks">2022 - Big Concrete Blocks</h4>
<ol>
<li>Move out</li>
<li>Invest in relationships</li>
<li>(work related) Scale Wine business, stabilise in new job</li>
</ol>
<p>High level enough for me to commit to, and write it down; I see these as foundational for more (and hopefully better) things to come.</p>
<p>Still at the cafe, still have time: on to the next post… evidently, my goal to clear my backlog of posts last year was only partially acheived. No sweat though - they&rsquo;re not as important as the BCBs.</p>
