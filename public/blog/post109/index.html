    <h4 id="the-duality-of-men">The duality of men</h4>
<p>There are many things on a spectrum, but there are a few which, in my mental model lies reasonably separate.</p>
<p>One such topic is the two types of people who view work in different ways:</p>
<p>On one camp, there are those view a job as primarily a money maker or means of survival. It makesa huge amount of sense as this has really been the default for almost all of humanity; and</p>
<p>In the modern era, with some having their basic needs met, there are those who strive for something more.
I largely identify with the latter.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, there are those industries which I suppose are mission than mercenary in nature. And theres a large part of me that makes it more compelling to work towards. Afterall, missionaries tend to attract more missionaries; and the same for mercernaries</p>
<p>But the majority of this post would be a commentary and story I&rsquo;ve told myself: in my choice of industry; in the roles i play</p>
<h4 id="something-of-a-story-something-of-a-belief">Something of a Story, something of a belief</h4>
<p>Theres definitely something about me being bit FOMO, and watching other industries accelerate ahead of the fields I generally feel a bit stronger towards.
Looking back I suppose i recognised the growth of the &ldquo;tech&rdquo; industry in my early into my own career after graduation.</p>
<p>I could also clarify that back in 2021, my initial study pathways and orientation towards chemical engineering was not one of passion, but merely, seemed reasonably viable and anchored to an important industry (energy), and that it offered pathways/ flexibility into other pursuits. The interest in energy, engineering and sustainability largely stemmed from there.</p>
<p>But i wonder too, how people find an industry they like working for. Perhaps more often than not, people dont really choose -  they go where the money is.</p>
<p>And what i&rsquo;ll write next acts as a small wishlist for someone who is thinking about work and what to do next</p>
<p>Perhaps i tell myself certain stories:</p>
<p>That i could have stayed and the done corporate things to the utmost extent;
That i could have picked a better paying path;</p>
<p>But i think my northstar is quite entrenched.</p>
<p>And at its core, its about doing something mission driven based on technology. and hardware (its hard). And I&rsquo;ve opted broadly to balance a bit of both. Something with both commercial and social value.</p>
<p>Something around Duty for social good, social service as the true purpose of effort, of work&hellip;</p>
<h4 id="a-quiet-wish">A quiet Wish</h4>
<p>The mission-driver in me can only wish but never impose. And comment on something around economic optimsation, or where to deploy the best and brightest:</p>
<p>Having done some business in new industries necessary to decarbonise, its been an uphill battle. Working within the realm of transition is one that needs comfort in uncertainty, expensive for consumers, and dealing with the government to boot. Juggling multiple fronts is not easy.</p>
<p>And i feel quietly envious of the best and brightest who did what makes the most sense - to join the booming and growing tech industry. But the broader question I had was also what would make the most sense for the world.</p>
<p>Take for example, doing Tech sales in a monopoly.
I&rsquo;m sure the best and brightest selling something that people are forced to use may not necessarily be the most optimal use of their creativity and capability.  Yet its such high- paying roles that do well, depsite being not in the area of what the world really needs: selling for a monopoly to grow the monopoly.</p>
<p>Again, its perfectly natural for the best to gravitate towards the best paying.</p>
<p>Similarly, Bright minds in finance or compliance. its service oriented, once again. But is it meaningful to have these minds come up with creative ways to find loop holes in compliance and carbon accounting? Or to read powerpoints and come up with creative narratives to investors?</p>
<p>Bullshit jobs can pay well, because <a href="https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post43/">modern intangible industries thrive</a> on this. But it is not WTWRNRN</p>
<p>There is a partial wish that&rsquo;s led me to consider why the best business developrrs or best sales man could work for industries that the most - from an economic optimisation perspective.</p>
<p>Why not use these bright minds to again  put their efforts towards putting effective, important technologies out; using their networks to bring clean energy industries together? Or to cater to the existing systems, while purposefully fulfilling the critical long term ones?</p>
<p>I mantain a position of believing that radically new business models and technology will be key to solving the world&rsquo;s biggest challenges. Ever more important that the best and brightest work in green technology industries.</p>
<p>Not so much lobbying for change - but merely and observation on how the world works.</p>
