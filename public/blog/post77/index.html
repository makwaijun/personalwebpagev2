There are plenty of people in the world with rather brilliant minds. Rarer though, are those who can blend in multiple dimensions but fit into a complete package.

  <article class="article mt-5">
    <p>Across my life, and as much as I stray away from people and am happily writing this while under quarantine in Shanghai, I come across specific individuals, which for a lack of a better word, are <strong>fascinating</strong>. I&rsquo;d be lying if this fascination didn&rsquo;t stir up an obsession akin to the &ldquo;curiosities&rdquo; in the 19th century.</p>
<p>There are plenty of people in the world with rather brilliant minds. Rarer though, are those who can blend in multiple dimensions but fit into a complete package. I mentally characterise these as at the &ldquo;great man&rdquo; archetype  - individuals who are equally skilled in thought as they are in execution and can be measured by impact.</p>
<p>But more commonly, brilliant people (thinkers) are a bit different. They break conventional norms in their own quirky way. I consider them by intellectual interests.</p>
<p>Some examples - Someone that made me feel as if they  had a unique insight into the world (almost like a omnipotent deity) but who, for some reason, types in rhyme and almost poetic cadence. Slightly nonsensical if not for the fact that crafting such language took real skill.</p>
<p>Another - living so high up in the theoretical clouds that the conversation seems otherworldly - about distant futures and abstract concepts, littered with blocks of datum from god knows how many fringe-sources. Untested and untestable hypotheses, questions about society and the inner workings of the world. The type of things that Gods are created to explain, and transcends our mortal capacity for thought and rationality.</p>
<p>I am drawn to it, for my attention is held and my mind is stayed. But on the other hand, I hadn&rsquo;t clue on their true role or value in society.
Are they artists of the immaterial? Oracles that bestow deliverance from other worries? Campfire storytellers and shamans of our modern times? The Fates that give us more  cryptic questions than practical answers?  (reading Neil Gaiman&rsquo;s Sandman recently)</p>
<p>Like many Scientific papers - the conclusion always ends with a list of further investigations that serves to acknowledge its distance to commercial or immediate real-world value.</p>
<p>It appears to me then that brilliance breeds exceptionality, and exceptionality breeds outliers.
and paradoxically, outliers can be ostracised.
The socially accepted narrative is that theyre a bit nerdy, extra contrarian or stubborn. Obsessively deep in their knowledge on the topic. Attracted to superfluous language to explain already complex issues&hellip;</p>
<p>Though I enjoy engaging such characters, the practical side of me is never able to form a close bond - an instinctual habit, which I am not sure whether it is bad to be associated with those too quirky; or whether because I place impact on a pedestal.</p>
<p>My mantra: All Ideas are commoditised; Its execution that counts.</p>
<p>Perhaps after a stint in working for the government (complex topics), I&rsquo;ve come to appreciate there are plenty of ideas from such individuals but it is always a challenge (not insurmountable, mind you) to make a tangible impact.</p>
<p>I myself, faced this struggle - how does one collect, convert and convey novel or highly abstract thoughts in a way that can lead to action?</p>
<p>Ironically, writing is my way of assuaging my inner geek. Is it common to find someone interested in sustainability, business, socio-economics, risotto, wine, human nature, psychology, philosophy? The world&rsquo;s a big place - and I&rsquo;d like to one day find that tribe.</p>
<p>I suppose writing and articulating is my attempt at contextualising my thoughts in a practical manner. But almost always, it is an indulgence of my own thoughts.</p>
<p>I miss such topics - as my professional life is far more hands-on.</p>
<p>To make an impact in the world, brilliance has to be contextualised. Brilliance needs packaging, and the right context to thrive.</p>
