Thoughts and Preamble Some thoughts i had before going in:
Solitary Quarantines are a strange thing. It made me wonder - for people of my generation these days, how those conditioned to hyperstimulation would be able to handle it. Also considered that solitary confinement would seem far more punishing on the human psyche than at any point prior in history. I also approached it with a sense of experimentation, and how i would take it. Background I stayed in the Mercure Hotel. Which was nice, as a business traveller hotel. If i rememebr correctly, we stayed for 14 days. I was with my CEO at the time.">

    <p><em>Another ancient draft post dug up. Time to recall and dig up the memories&hellip;.</em></p>
<h3 id="thoughts-and-preamble">Thoughts and Preamble</h3>
<p>Some thoughts i had before going in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solitary Quarantines are a strange thing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It made me wonder - for people of my generation these days, how those conditioned to hyperstimulation would be able to handle it.</li>
<li>Also considered that solitary confinement would seem far more punishing on the human psyche than at any point prior in history.</li>
<li>I also approached it with a sense of experimentation, and how i would take it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>I stayed in the Mercure Hotel. Which was nice, as a business traveller hotel. If i rememebr correctly, we stayed for 14 days. I was with my CEO at the time.</p>
<h4 id="getting-there">Getting there:</h4>
<p>The rough sequence was: disembarking from the plane, being herded through a fixed route. Getting a nasty nasal swab test, going through immigration, eventually reaching a section with various booths representing different areas (qu). A bus, equipped with all manners of plastic flaps came to get us.</p>
<p>The booths were kitted out with touristy marketing for each of the regions which was a well meaning attempt to welcome people within such circumstances.</p>
<p>I think we got off the plane at 9pm, and reached the hotel at 3am.</p>
<h4 id="routine">Routine:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Morning swab test (mouth)</li>
<li>Fairly fixed mealtimes, notified by a knock on the door.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="physiological">Physiological</h4>
<ul>
<li>I drink about 4L of water within 36 hours or so. I suppose tha . Chapped lips did nudge me to drink a lot more.</li>
<li>I put in effort to keep my body active. Following Jordan Yeoh&rsquo;s 30 or so minute programme.</li>
<li>Food was fairly routine:
<ul>
<li>Breakfast: Porridge with salted pickles, a bao, corn on the cob</li>
<li>Lunch, Dinner: Rice with a meat, veg and tofu dish. Often similar seasonings</li>
<li>I practically ate everything given except the corn. The super oily Ma La seasoning was great.</li>
<li>Brought my own instant noodles (tom yum kokaaaaa) and chocolate which helped with flabour diversity too</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="guest-experience">Guest Experience</h4>
<ul>
<li>There was a wechat group set up to make requests</li>
<li>Man, some people can be needy and whiny as hell (asking for new toothbrushes or toilet paper for what seemed like everyday)</li>
<li>But the majority were fairly normal</li>
<li>Able to order other stuff off the menu, but i didnt dare try due to anxiety around payment and communication</li>
<li>Able to order delviery in, but i didnt dare, for the same reason above</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-was-illegal">What was Illegal</h4>
<ul>
<li>Knives (even fruit knives)</li>
<li>Alcohol</li>
<li>Hot food (only processed food or fruits were allowed to be delivered)
Interesting&hellip;..</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="psychological">Psychological</h4>
<ul>
<li>Constant, baseline anxiety</li>
<li>Day 1 anxiety soon gave way to an introvert&rsquo;s bliss</li>
<li>But after Day 6, i started to feel it&hellip;.</li>
<li>Would call friends /family on occasion, to stay sane too.</li>
<li>Also took up daily Mandarin lessons - as a means of being productive too</li>
<li>Can&rsquo;t recall if i brough at gaming devices. Brought two books if i remember correctly (finished one of them at least)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="chinese-and-china-experience">Chinese and China Experience</h4>
<ul>
<li>This was interesting: My chinese was (is) terrible, and the not-Chinese and gestures could only get you so far. Had to stay calm, and be resourceful enough to figure things out.</li>
<li>Need for a local phone number and apps engrained in super insular system. Very little support for foreigners using local apps during this period (a year later, its improved a lot since then)</li>
<li>Working staff just did their jobs just to the extent where they won&rsquo;t get in trouble. Had to do certain things (zero flexibility), but also unsure how to address off-the-book requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just documenting and immortalising the memory&hellip;was certainly and experience.</p>
