  <meta property="og:description" content="Gaming has been a long standing past time of mine. But growing up, there was negative aura around it, due to its poor perception that it can be addictive and distracting from what perhaps mattered more at that stage.
Not wholly untrue, as there can be an addictive counter productive nature to games that many parents like to pick up on (time is clearly better spent studying) As a result, I carry an engrained guilt around it, though its a small matter in the bigger picture. There are times I can spend the better part of a Friday night or weekend on a new game - it can be thoroughly enjoying, but I retain that niggling feeling of guilt as I am unproductive in the real world.">

    <p>Gaming has been a long standing past time of mine.
But growing up, there was negative aura around it,  due to its poor perception that it can be addictive and distracting from what perhaps mattered more at that stage.</p>
<p>Not wholly untrue, as there can be an addictive counter productive nature to games that many parents like to pick up on (time is clearly better spent studying)
As a result, I carry an engrained guilt around it, though its a small matter in the bigger picture. There are times I can spend the better part of a Friday night or weekend on a new game - it can be thoroughly enjoying, but I retain that niggling feeling of guilt as I am unproductive in the real world.</p>
<p>This post documents some personal thoughts on gaming.</p>
<p>There are many aspects to this hobby that I like:</p>
<h4 id="socialising-for-introverts">Socialising for Introverts</h4>
<p>It can be introvertedly social at times, without the need for speaking or communication. It&rsquo;s weird interacting with other a moving object, controls hidden behind avatars and rules and knowing a human being is behind that screen. Who are they? Where do they come from? We will never know.</p>
<h4 id="elevated-mental-state">Elevated Mental state</h4>
<p>Another state of peace and calm is flow. And the distraction or better said - focus -, is game can help to achieve. Not always mind you, in between me reading guides (to not miss out anything)</p>
<p>The element of wonder, and escape too. An experience in ambience, a new world to explore.</p>
<h4 id="pleasing-our-intrisic-wants">Pleasing our Intrisic wants</h4>
<p>There is an element of catering to my perfectionist instincts. Save scumming, seeing future outcomes, dialling back time to change the destiny of the world/battle/avatar I am shaping.</p>
<p>Less elegantly, some games are just another form of a dopamine hit, rewarded for the effort of the brain, fingers and sitting at a computer for 10 hours.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d add that there is something truly strange about me for some games (witcher, BOTW). I take FOREVER to complete, almost as if I am afraid that the journey will end.</p>
<h3 id="deeper-reflection">Deeper Reflection</h3>
<p>Like any reflective post there are some elements that resound deeply within me.</p>
<p>One is of geek / nerd identity, something abstract between the conventional and unconventional, yet succeeding in my own unique way.</p>
<p>One heavily impactful, though benign when it was said, was the reputation I had for excelling (somewhat, kinda declined) academically, and physically (just fitness and stamina), and at the beautiful miracle of World of Warcraft.
Being one of the most-raided player in my year grade, with top tier gear, and didn&rsquo;t completely flunk out.</p>
<p>But school aside, WoW also provided a sanctuary, a new refuge in a world away from a world.</p>
<p>I still remember vividly and being completely awestruck at creating my character in teldrassil for the first time. My dear night elf rogue, who would go on to do great things&hellip;</p>
<p>WoW also played a role in first leadership experience ever, and looking back, had given me a flavour of what it was to lead - sheer competence, fairness and communication mixed in with fun and a good tem. Yet another nice memory from my teenage years.
There were some tensions, no doubt with my parents as every minute on a game was time spent not being &lsquo;productive&rsquo;; there were also times where i would much rather be in Azeroth than be in the real world, especially with an incomplete dungeon on hand (commitment to stranger&rsquo;s avatars over people you actually know.</p>
<p>If this section sounds like a love letter to WoW, it proably is . In many ways, WoW encapsulated a lot of fond experiences I had with gaming</p>
<h3 id="future-of-gaming">Future of gaming</h3>
<p>From a personal point of view I think I play less for sure, though I still try to find time, on occasion.
Based on more recent trends, I never really got into, and in principle, dislike free to play games.</p>
<p>None made worse by mobile games which I don&rsquo;t touch at all. I&rsquo;d like to think that I&rsquo;m taking a stand against these, but at the same time it reveals a generation divide in a new era of gaming.</p>
<p>There is talk too now of a metaversee and what not, likely going through its maturity period.</p>
<p>It will be intersting to experience in an older age. When my physical body no longer works as it did; when I ail and wish for more. Perhaps games will continue to be a source of entertainment and stimulation then. Keeping the mind active, limited by the body.</p>
<h3 id="appendix">Appendix:</h3>
<p>Best games of all time / very invested in, formative in some ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aoe - first game</li>
<li>Witcher 3</li>
<li>World of Warcraft</li>
<li>Dynasty warriors</li>
<li>Left 4 dead, day of defeat</li>
<li>Bf bad company 2</li>
<li>Total war series</li>
<li>Company of heroes</li>
<li>Overcooked 2</li>
<li>Recently rimworld</li>
<li>Final Fantasy and JRPGs of all sorts</li>
</ul>
