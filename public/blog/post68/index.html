    <p>I was in the sea today. And saw the buoys bobbing. I set a target; an unconcious marker to swim to before returning to shore.</p>
<p>And while swimming, I we were boats, travailing on the open sea. But in the ocean - the winds buffet and blow. Mother nature is unpredictable.</p>
<p>And so we need an anchor. Or anchor_s_, as I shall explain:</p>
<h3 id="support-systems">Support systems</h3>
<p>There are many theories around us humans as social creatures.</p>
<p>That no man (or woman) can go at it alone.</p>
<p>That behind every strong man is a strong woman (or man, god I&rsquo;m so progressive waow)</p>
<p>Teamwork makes the dream work</p>
<hr>
<p>But human vulnerability is a real thing, and in the pursuit of self discovery and self mastery, others have played and will continue to play a huge role in this.</p>
<p>But a realisation I had was that (as a single guy), a support system is exactly a system - with are multiple actors, interrelations and at times, a non-linear complexity to it. I would still theorise - that even with a life-partner, we are too complex for a single actor to be a sole pillar of support. (interested to see this challenged, I come from an urban / fast paced environment).</p>
<p>It stems from a belief that - even with trust in place, we show different people different dimensions of our self. Each dimension of us have different needs, comfort levels, and connections looking for a tether. I picture a neural synapse, grasping out into the void, and wishing for something to snag on.</p>
<p>Parents, siblings, family and friends may play different roles in our lives, but combined, they can cover all parts, insecurities and weaknesses of one.</p>
<p>And I find these to be without limits (especially with the global reach of technology). I termed these as Allies in my previoist post.</p>
<p>Despite them being spread out across the world - a video or voice call is so easy to get to. Good allies can be nostalgically distant, but are unshaken by awakward pretense of it all.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter. The support is here. Its now. and just when one needs it.</p>
<h3 id="finitude">Finitude</h3>
<p>But allies are not immortal. And the closer the friendship, the bond - the greater the pain of loss. There is a transiency to such Support Systems too. Change happens, whether within our control, or not. This thinking was discussed around a single word a good friend shared with me: Finitude. Simple in its meaning, powerful in its concept.</p>
<p>Its the eventuality of the end.</p>
<p>It pushes us and our egos to do more in pursuit of glory. Or to make our time meaningful. Perhaps to leave a legacy.</p>
<p>And this can be traced back to the finitude of it all, and the importance that people play in self-satisfying our selves (ego), as much as we are a part of their lives too. We can be lonely at times, but to be lonely with a support system made all the difference - I remain comforted by the presence and solidity of others, even if they may not be there in person.</p>
<h3 id="the-royal-court-of-support">The Royal Court of Support</h3>
<p>(To be envisaged with fan-cey medieval court)</p>
<p>If we were all the kings and yaaas queens of our own court.</p>
<p>I would seek a gluttonous chef to serve and eat the best goddam food;
A cold viceroy to keep us grounded;
A jester to make us all laugh;
A lover;
A bodyguard for security and protection;
A matron, to care for the child within us.
A wiseman, for distilled, sharp advice;
A friendly rival, to keep us both on our toes;
A patient listener; a shoulder to cry on - with a heart full of sympathy;
A seneschal to tidy up our domestic affairs;
A free-spirit; for reckless adventure</p>
<p>&hellip; there are plenty more, but this would be a good start.</p>
<p>Who is in your court?</p>
<p>I also want to contemplate on how could I be a stronger pillar of support for others. To be that comfort zone for others. I&rsquo;m not likely to be the jester. But a trusted advisor. I&rsquo;d to be thought of that way.</p>
