It was different this time.
In the preceding year, I was focused on understanding, applying and trialing different observations from various leaders and managers. In particular, I was taken to the concept of Servant Leadership: which I layer on a fundamental belief that humans do desire to be productive; and if well directed, may miss their target due to 3 fundamental factors: resourcing, competency, and bottlenecks and decisions. The assumption here is that the targets and strategy are well set.">

    <p>Another year, another In Camp Training (Singapore reservist shenanigans).  My 9th year of ICT (how time flies), and the 7th cycle in the &ldquo;syllabus&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was different this time.</p>
<p>In the preceding year, I was focused on understanding, applying and trialing different observations from various leaders and managers. In particular, I was taken to the concept of Servant Leadership: which I layer on a fundamental belief that humans do desire to be productive; and if well directed, may miss their target due to 3 fundamental factors: resourcing, competency, and bottlenecks and decisions. The assumption here is that the targets and strategy are well set.</p>
<p>Attending, and serving these three factors are key to a team&rsquo;s progress.</p>
<h3 id="on-collective-achivement">On Collective Achivement</h3>
<p>And with every experiment, must come a result or a feedback. And this year did showcase it well. We did well. Our company, did well.</p>
<p>So far, the thesis holds. But it remains a fresh learning and this universal framework will continue to be built on; refined.</p>
<p>Especially towards its end, when, as I hauled myself up for a final closing address, I noticed something missing. A sense of heart and pride; which reflects my rather cold approach in &ldquo;tick-boxing&rdquo; things. Perhaps it was the rather intense 72 or so hours, driven by sleeplessness and the intense heat of the exercise. Or perhaps it was my weary body, worn down and a hollow shell of weak energy.<br>
Not to be completely faulted, as I had certainly pushed myself through an Acute upper respiratory infection, 1 day before going outfield (note below). Practically not slept (ugh camping) during the night out, and still managed to lead a full day of inspections, checking, updating, deciding, instructing, and, serving.</p>
<p>My closing address was more a recital, than an impassioned celebration. Although, respect is hard earned, and it this case, not easily lost.</p>
<p>*Buttons to press: i drank at least 7L of water that afternoon, saw a dr, drank probably double the dose of cough syrup; and when i needed to suppress - Afrin spray has been an aboslute MVP, while also plying myself with Redoxon and Lactoforte supplements throughout. But i also think that walking/moving with light work, outdoors in the sun, has been far better a medication than being indoors unable to sleep&hellip;</p>
<p>There remains a missing element.</p>
<h3 id="on-the-motivators-of-men">On the Motivators of Men</h3>
<p>I have intrinsic weaknesses (which not only apply to leadership, but to myself too). Rarely do i Praise, or celebrate. When to be tough, calculated and cold? When to be warm, forthcoming and light?</p>
<p>and in this note, i will completely gloss over motivating factors like &ldquo;pay&rdquo; and materialism, which is probably immensely important in the working world, but a simple game of numbers that is oftend determined by other factor.</p>
<p>In the recent case, I would add some caveats too, at least in the militaristic context:
The rarer and more temporary struggle here is motivating under the constraints of few carrots (obligation, not a reward) nor sticks (lack of consequences). It underpins an overall struggle getting a bunch of guys from &ldquo;normal&rdquo; office life, to go under 35C heat to do unglamorous and laborious tasks.</p>
<p>Yet, my conversations yield varied remarks: Some are acutely trading off with family and duties at home; Others, saw it as an escape from the drudgery of their day jobs, or of a period of life. I sensed, as for myself too, for those leading a live of monotony (classical Singaporean work, work, personal, work time balance), a small window of a higher calling.</p>
<p>i had to reduce the things we do (be it work, or reservist) to just some time-bound experience:</p>
<p>How do experiences in suffering, stress, and effort correlate to feelings of dread, tolerance or even inspiration? How does personal Agency (LINK HERE), confound such patterns?</p>
<p>How do these manifest in the told-to-do vs the self-motivated doers?</p>
<p>This mental bookmark would probably require far further lived experience and experimentation.</p>
<p>I would use this post to add a note after reading Napoleon, who also remarked (albeit at the higher echelons/grand chess mastery) of people driven by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Influence - As in Cambeceres</li>
<li>Power - As in Fouche</li>
<li>Ideology - bit broader, Vive l&rsquo;impereur</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, individuals not turned by materialism, but a higher order of internal desires.</p>
