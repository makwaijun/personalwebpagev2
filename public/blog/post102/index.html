    <p>As I draw closer towards permanance and consistency, a natural flow towards the rightful or wrongful ossification of my beliefs;</p>
<p>while at the same time, forseeing the inevitable curiosity and interest of my peers into the markings of the flesh;</p>
<p>How does one think with conviction, to inscribe a concept or symbol onto their inherited birthright?</p>
<p>Principally, I feel strongly about two universal frameworks: of Cycles and Systems, though I largely approach this in a scientific and geometric pattern-spotting sorta of way, as opposed to the Buddhist Dharma-esque approach which indeeds captures such thinking too.</p>
<h3 id="the-theory-of-cycles">The Theory of Cycles:</h3>
<p>In my own rambly deifintion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cycles, as defined by a sequence of data points forming a line, amplitude, and frequency, that is continuous, changing, capturing both past and present</p></blockquote>
<p>The Theory of Cycles is a good reminder of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change is always constant, and one has to be adaptable</li>
<li>There are changes in the intensity (amplitude) and frequency (..aka&hellip;frequency) of change.</li>
<li>There are periods of volatility and stability, depending on how frequent changes are</li>
<li>There are steady states and Step changes, depending on how major the amplitudes change</li>
<li>Life, indeed has its up and downs.</li>
<li>There is humility in the ever-changing cycles - what was a correct response in the past may not be the correct response today</li>
<li>Yet, there are also lessons to be learnt from past cycles (i.e. history is a teacher, and some times has repeating patterns)</li>
<li>Resilience to cycles can be defined by upper or lower thresholds (i.e. horizontal line)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="application">Application:</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used this to describe other universal concepts such as
<a href="https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post38/">Economics</a> or
Sustainability - <em>we often talk about points of no return (when amplitude change is irreversibly high), and the system does not have the capacity to self-correct</em></p>
<p>But such thinking can apply to mood as well:</p>
<p>Feeling low, feeling high; cathartic / mental breaks occur when amplitude change is temporarily at a peak.</p>
<p>Many blocks of stress in the same time period can cause  &ldquo;limits&rdquo; or threshoholds to be breached when the amplitude of stress / worry is too high.</p>
<p>Naturally, I suppose my pursuit for discomfort zones has often times created an environment of high amplitude and high frequency change. Something that leans against my physical and mental durability.</p>
<h3 id="the-theory-of-systems">The Theory of Systems:</h3>
<p>Also, in own off-the-cuff definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Systems, as defined by non-linear complex networks of interrelated entities; best illustrated as a series of interconnected dots and lines</p></blockquote>
<p>The Theory of systems is a good reminder of:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is always a reason and things explained by underlying causes</li>
<li>Problems have root causes, and may only surface on the second, third, fourth degree</li>
<li>A first degree response may have unintended consequences (or other <em>spillover effects</em>)</li>
<li>There are almost <strong>always</strong> <a href="https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post88/">trade offs</a></li>
<li>There is very little linearity in life</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="application-1">Application:</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used it to describe the interrelations of various universal frameworks in the past.</p>
<p>Its a concept I&rsquo;ve also applied to understand people better - what drives them to behave in a certain way? Thereasons could possibly be due to nearer term second or third order reasons; or fourth order theories on their childhood and upbringing. Some applied psychoanalysis if you will.</p>
<p>It probably preoccupies my mind too much - but indeed, I have a fascination with the interconnectedness of things.</p>
<hr>
<p>Surely that should bear enough weight to provide sufficient conviction to get a tattoo on some graphical representation of these concepts&hellip;</p>
<p>Of course, the subsequent question is where&hellip;</p>
