It was warm, friendly, if slightly unfamiliar setting; the scent of cheese and red wine, good conversations and banter. Rather Jovial. Up until, someone probed - on what one’s greatest fear could be.
Common fears bandied around the table included death (which was later clarified as the awareness of death), insignifiance (or legacy, as I term it), loneliness (which again, was discussed under the context of the solitude and highly individualised experience of one’s own death)">

    <h1 id="on-fear-and-death">On Fear and Death</h1>
<p>The sort of post that anyone who thinks too much for their own good, must eventually tolerate and write.</p>
<p>It was warm, friendly, if slightly unfamiliar setting; the scent of cheese and red wine, good conversations and banter. Rather Jovial. Up until, someone probed - on what one&rsquo;s greatest fear could be.</p>
<p>Common fears bandied around the table included death (which was later clarified as the <em>awareness</em> of death), insignifiance (or legacy, as I term it), loneliness (which again, was discussed under the context of the solitude and highly individualised experience of one&rsquo;s own death)</p>
<p>As much as I have contemplated and meditated one a wide range of topics, the question of Fear was one that I struggled to have a ready answer immediately. An important question - as I intuitively believe that the answer beneath this drives a lot of fundamental behaviours and actions in how we live our lives, whether concious or subconcious.</p>
<p>I also believe that dreams can be ultimately categorised into desires and fears. The things, the moments that we crave and what we worry about the most. It&rsquo;s not a watertight belief, but it helps explain.</p>
<p>I find it rather interesting, that death was frequently cited as either the dominant cause or in something that was highly interrelated with it.</p>
<p>Indeed, there is a general concern of death as the phenomena in itself (whether of one&rsquo;s own or other individuals close to the person), or that the finitude of life forces a mark to be left and a craving for legacy. Momento Mori, death awareness,  seems to be a primal driving force around this.</p>
<p>Of course, one could broadly explain it from an evolutionary point of view - that we all have inbuilt mechanisms to survive and avoid death: fear is a great tool to have to avoid this.</p>
<p>As an investigation into the topic of death, I was reminded by another friend, who went down the deep, dark, youtube hole, where a subgenre of death documentaries turned out to be a popular thing. Vlogs of individuals facing terminal illnesses, some more debilitating than others. But there was a common trend: most vlogs would heavily involve the patient&rsquo;s friends and family. It could have been a bit biased: some in their final stages required caretakers, something</p>
<hr>
<p>On an individual level, its a topic worth answering, given its subtle capacity to influence our choices and actions. Similar to past views on religon (peace), and other reflections, an investigation is warranted.</p>
<p>And what is it that I fear the most?</p>
<p>Is it at the point of Death itself? Perhaps not - as I neither fear the storied fears of the afterlife. A state of nothingness neither bliss nor suffering, is not something I fear.</p>
<p>Is it the pain of going through the process itself? Perhaps - a loss of quality of life is an even greater worry</p>
<p>Or is it something else related to the span of life. Likely - and so is the pursuit of something. More than the food in the mouth or the air that i breathe. Does the question persit and belie.</p>
<p>Fear and life married in one. As is the abandonment of fear; to live a live fearlessly.</p>
