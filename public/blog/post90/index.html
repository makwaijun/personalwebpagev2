    <p>Retirement has been a topic recently. Cropping up in some conversations.</p>
<p>Certainly not applicable for myself at this hustly career focused stage. Neither am I an immediate proponent of the Financially Independent, Retire Early movement. I suspect the inner survival instinct and drive will lead me to continue to work.</p>
<p>Instead, the conversations are centred around myself and my peers whose  parents are entering the zone of retirement.</p>
<p>It also ties in to some recent 2023 planning (which could be a post in itself - though slightly curated for a truly public version. There are hidden areas and desires of oneself that I&rsquo;d keep close to heart)</p>
<p>Some points that emerged from such conversations:</p>
<p>The first point is that people retire in different ways. And that&rsquo;s a personal choice.</p>
<p>Some like to keep intensely busy;
while others aim to retire as soon as its practicable.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m certain of is that the notion of retirement could be easily change in the future. And it&rsquo;s best to be prepared. We may work longer, and my cynical outlook is that there may be significant adversities or radical disruptions to the plan.</p>
<p>Second, it&rsquo;d be good if retirement was centred around the principle of freedom.</p>
<ol>
<li>Health - minimising the restrictions of the mind and body</li>
<li>Social / Communal - minimsing obligations to others (frankly, including family, etc)</li>
<li>Similarly, minimising obligations of others to me -  I wish those important and those around me to be as free as I am.</li>
<li>Financial - minimising debt and whats materially owed to others</li>
</ol>
<p>I think thats a relatively good starting point.</p>
<h3 id="retirement-budgeting">Retirement budgeting</h3>
<p>For now, planning ahead, as I like to do, will largely look at this from a financial point of view, which starts today. Something of a plan, something of a guideline. Good to get started either way.
At this stage, I&rsquo;m hesistant to fix numbers. Instead, I&rsquo;ll use ratios based on median pay. I think it&rsquo;s a suitable way to establish baselines for a very unknown future.</p>
<h4 id="basic-needs-1x-median-pay">Basic needs (1x median pay)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Roof over the head</li>
<li>Food on the table</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="basic-wants-2x-median-pay">Basic wants (2x median pay)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Some nice meals and drinks</li>
<li>1 big trip</li>
<li>1 small trip</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="luxurious-wants-3-4x-median-pay">Luxurious wants (3-4x median pay)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Additional travel</li>
<li>Unecessary luxuries</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve this:</p>
<h4 id="removing-outflows">Removing outflows</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Minimising debt - not sure when things can get paid off, and by when</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximising Sources of income - how does one get there?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Property rental</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cpf and savings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monetising stock holdings or investments like..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stock dividends</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bonds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liquidation of stock</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Investments too, could be tied to how I intend to retire. By supporting businesses in an advisory role, very much hinged on how much I learn today.</p>
<p>Some stuff to think about, today.</p>
