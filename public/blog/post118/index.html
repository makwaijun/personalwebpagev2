As a recap, my last two posts in this series explored:
The spectrum of effectiveness, which ranges from benevolent dictatorships to unfeterred democracy. An additional observation about people: those dispositioned to balance/intuition (aka Jedi) versus those who believe in absolutism (aka the sith) These were perhaps a broader on the high level reflections of the systems we see in the world, and the types of people who vote.">

    <p><em>On a flight back from the US to Singapore, dug out an old draft to see if it can be finished</em></p>
<p>It would appear its time for the annual post on Politics. Not terribly irrelevant, givent that Singapore will likely have an election this year too.</p>
<p>As a recap, my last two posts in this series explored:</p>
<ul>
<li>The spectrum of effectiveness, which ranges from benevolent dictatorships to unfeterred democracy.</li>
<li>An additional observation about people: those dispositioned to balance/intuition (aka Jedi) versus those who believe in absolutism (aka the sith)</li>
</ul>
<p>These were perhaps a broader on the high level reflections of the systems we see in the world, and the types of people who vote.</p>
<p>This post aims to unify the two for what matters the most: Voting.</p>
<h4 id="premises">Premises</h4>
<p>First, that political governance ideally demands serving the state over self. This, in itself is a strong claim - one that I personally believe in, but like many things, may or may not really
true.</p>
<p>Second, that politics will ultimately be fronted by a Human, and with it, all their indvidual strengths and drawbacks. We are not yet at the stage of electing our AI overlords.</p>
<p>Third, no nation (in a globalised world) exists in a vacuum. There are always external challenges to deal with (economically, naturally, geopolitically). These are factors out of control: powerless are the voters, powerless are the electees.</p>
<p>Fourth, with inherent human nature and the complexity of challenges, it is <em>impossible</em> to please everyone. There are winners and losers.</p>
<p>Fifth, Political actions are driven by short-term and long-term motivations, although modern democracies favour the former.</p>
<p>Sixth, Political actions are restrained by institutions. These favour long-term motivations. Check and balances, structural norms, etc.</p>
<p>Seventh, both the Voters and Electorate are ultimately motivated by the preservation of Power. (of course, the power of a Prime Minister to lead a country and the power/agency of a shopkeeper to keep a shop running are of different magnitudes, but speaks to the root concept of individual Power)</p>
<p>Eigth, the ultimate game for the electorate is to Perform <em>well enough</em> to maintain majority, to preserve their own power. This involves influencing others, with tribalism being on the extreme end of things.</p>
<h4 id="maturing-political-structures-for-an-increasingly-complex-world">Maturing Political Structures for an increasingly Complex World</h4>
<p>With climate change, increased competition, (no more Pax Americana, thank you very much) and peak inequality: I am curious as to whether the existing political norms are sufficient.</p>
<p>Drawing a parallel concept from the Start-up world: i see it necessary for both individuals and the collective to learn as fast as possible, to iterate quickly enough to make the decision needed to (aforementioned) <em>Perform Well Enough</em>.</p>
<p>Layering on the concept of efficiency to the previous model, I now consider:</p>
<p>Poltiical quadrant 1: Benevolent dictatorship - serving society over individuals, high efficiency
Quadrant 2: Ideal democracy - serving society over individuals, inefficiently
Quadrant 3: unideal democracy - serving individuals over society, inefficiently
Quadrant 4: tyrannical dictatorship - serving individuals over society, efficiently</p>
<p>Equally important, within the stated concept of efficiency is the ability to navigate the institutions and constraints (planning boundaries).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve stated my position before: that dictatorships can be, rightly or wrongly, relentlessly efficient, as opposed to the consensus building necessity of democracies. I add that while dictatorships are at risk of making the wrong decisions (due to poor check and balance systems), I&rsquo;d like to recognise the fact that it enables the collective body to learn faster as well. The response to COVID was a good test of this.</p>
<h4 id="what-does-it-mean-as-voter">What does it mean as Voter</h4>
<p>Objectively, the best choice would naturally depend on circumstance:</p>
<p>Quadrant 4 has the ability to maximise one&rsquo;s own power, assuming you&rsquo;re politically connected (see it in Oligarchal structures).</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not, Quadrant 3 could work, on the a basis to preserve your own power in a body aspiring to <em>Perform Well Enough</em> for the majority.</p>
<p>However, <em>Well Enough</em>, will necessirate effiiient trade-offs, and if you&rsquo;re a minority (who gets shafted for the greater good), Quadrant 2 is probably the way to go.</p>
<p>Quadrant 3 is probably the worst. It&rsquo;d be interesting to identify countries in this stage (somehow.. im not a political scientist)</p>
<p>Regardless of which Quadrant is selected, there will be a face and name to vote for.</p>
<p>So why does someone follow someone: Strength? Vision? Competency? Belief?</p>
<p>Charisma and speeches aside, I would also add the following considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restraints: What instituions are you bound to? What institutions is the electee bound to?</li>
<li>Efficiency: Are the electees competent enough to navigate an increasingly complex world?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="my-concerns-in-a-singaporean-context">My Concerns (In a Singaporean Context)</h4>
<p>Caveat and disclosure: I strongly identify myself within Quadrant 3.</p>
<ol>
<li>The next engine of growth - what economic development means for developed economies, while balancing with domestic needs (more thoughts on this in a later post). At the same time, gratitude is necessary for breaking out of the middle income trap</li>
<li>Of a maturing Benevolent Dictatorship and the governing body&rsquo;s Security and Resilience (and more specfically, the ability to make short-term unpopular, but <em>Sound Enough</em> decisions in the long term.</li>
<li>The balance between Institutional Restraint and maintaing Efficiency in an increasingly complex world.</li>
</ol>
<p>Politics is a game of control and Power. Of people and the systems they exist in. Its an exercise in immense complexity to surpass the odds and do well. Failing this is a big deal: The inability to manage both external and itnernal factors well is what leads to war. Yes. War is bad.</p>
<p>Side reflection: The US model is interesting - giving the illusion of unfettered freedom, opportunity and identity, but shackled and fettered by a capitalist system.</p>
