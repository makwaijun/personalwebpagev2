<h4 id="conception">Conception</h4>
<p>If what I do is common - I tend to read the latest few posts and first post when visiting a new blog. So I hope dear reader, to make this count.</p>
<p>It took the better part of one and a half-ish days over the long weekend to get this up and running.</p>
<p>I had been mulling <em>for a long time</em> to built my own website.</p>
<p>The world is relentlessly digitising.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to thrive in the modern world without having our very essence of being - identity, knowledge, and more - digitised in some way . People upload themselves to the omnipotent cloud through a great many channels, giving birth to a digital twin. For better or worse, this twin represents us across all aspects of life;  Our careers, relationships, hobbies to name a few.</p>
<p>I believe that there is much more to an individual than curated pictures, comments and memes. This digital twin however, is a hollow shell. Lacking the heart and warmth of ourselves.</p>
<p>So how does one fill this shell?</p>
<p>In an attempt to do so, I endeavoured to build my own website. To build a viewing window into my own mind and on my terms. A digital footprint with WJ&rsquo;s stamp of approval.</p>
<p>Fairly early into the process, I preconceived this project to be a highly personalised one - a digital trail that ought be customisable and built by my own hands. As a result, I steered away from prebuilt options like Wordpress or Wix - though as a beginner, it was impossible to run away from prebuilt templates, ~~as seen here ~~ (update: adapted to make my own Hugo template).</p>
<p>In the longer run, I intend to use this site to keep track of developments in my thinking, a creative outlet and a repository of passions.  I envision and hope that his would remain active for many years to come. It would be an interesting time capsule to revisit ideas new and old.</p>
<h4 id="how-this-was-built">How this was built</h4>
<p>From a very scrappy start (i.e. zero knowledge), there were a few main guides i followed below. Along the way, I recgonised that if my <em>intent</em> is to blog (with absolutely zero PHP/ backend knowledge), something more practical than a pure HTML/CSS site was needed.  After finding out that Static Site Generators (SSGs) could be fit for my purpose, I chose Hugo over Jekyll &hellip; I just read something somewhere. Got to stay with the trends I suppose.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkeOuwF8g8s">A bootstrap 4 tutorial</a>, which piqued my interest in HTML/CSS again, since half-completing a course last Christmas.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GnFZ8XpMak">how to build a website on Hugo</a>, very clear and good guide - would certainly recommend it, though I faced issues in deploying in the last step.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5qNpRGB7Qw">how to create an SSH key</a> in a desperate attempt to fix a roadblock i faced when doing 2. I had no idea what was going on.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBQlCtfRmqs&amp;t=1s">how to deploy with netlify</a>, since i was stuck on some git issues for gitpages which i couldn&rsquo;t wrap my amateur head around. Found this channel&rsquo;s content to be pretty good.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/start-blog-with-hugo/">guides</a> <a href="https://zwbetz.com/make-a-hugo-blog-from-scratch/">i didn&rsquo;t</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6xpOpKBZ2k">quite</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-i5rZwlfu4">get through</a>.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-picked-up-along-the-way">Things I picked up along the way&hellip;</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>HTML/CSS</li>
<li>Bootstrap 4 which was useful refresher, but not critical for this approach. Will nonetheless come in handy later when i try to customise things;</li>
<li>Using github and visual studio code;</li>
<li>Creating an SSH Key for github (again, unnecessary);</li>
<li>Jumping around command prompt, powershell, and git &hellip; and the innumerable errors when loading adding submodules (which still didn&rsquo;t work);</li>
<li>Deploying the site (and buying a domain). This was by far the most confusing part for me; and</li>
<li>Writing in Markdown (as I am doing right now).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 id="features-to-add">Features to Add</h4>
<p>Having ideated on some of these elements for a while, perhaps I can finally list some of these down here:</p>
<h5 id="sections">Sections</h5>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> CV/ Resume (see lifestack project - skill and life timeline mapping)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Network analysis (email network?)</li>

<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> Interests - Cooking (added in blog format)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Interests - Travel (map of where i&rsquo;ve been + a illustrative photo?)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Add goodreads/ other online profiles (updated 10 may)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Add section on things i subscribe to/ like to read</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> SEO - so that this site appears when my name is say googled</li>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> Customising the layout template in Hugo (probably quite technical - updated 10 May)</li>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> Integrating other static pages (updated: Resume and About page are static)</li>
</ul>
