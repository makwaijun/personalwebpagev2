            Just&hellip;a note that I came across this article from a Sustainability VC investor.
It notes the move of talent from conventional big tech companies towards climate tech.
Conforms to my framework on economic chapters. The best talent switching indstries? - check! Additive fields (i.e, Climate + Tech) - check!
I love picking up reinforcing data points and patting myself on the back :) . Tastes like Cherries.

            Inequality is real and everywhere. Inequality begets privilege.
In my thinking, I define privilege with an emphasis on inheritance - for example a superior position bestowed upon people brought up or born into positions of above average wealth, of no effort of their own. Merely through birthright and luck.
I&rsquo;ve felt its mostly a blessing and a little bit of a curse. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong - it is objectively better to be privileged, but I&rsquo;d add a consideration that being privileged could lead to greater expectations are more to lose.

            This post will be a story; and a story of a young man&rsquo;s internal conflict. On Accidental heroism, and the vanity of it all.
I remember it vividly. I remember it well.
It was a gray morning. I remember it as a hefty sense of morning tiredness - Bleary eyed, I had gotten off the bus, sauntering towards work. There was a long day ahead of a visit programme with a client, and much to do and be mindful of. I was distant and inattentive. I noticed a few policeman, presumably temporarily detaining and discussing around a person. Inconsequential really.

            Across my life, and as much as I stray away from people and am happily writing this while under quarantine in Shanghai, I come across specific individuals, which for a lack of a better word, are fascinating. I&rsquo;d be lying if this fascination didn&rsquo;t stir up an obsession akin to the &ldquo;curiosities&rdquo; in the 19th century.
There are plenty of people in the world with rather brilliant minds. Rarer though, are those who can blend in multiple dimensions but fit into a complete package. I mentally characterise these as at the &ldquo;great man&rdquo; archetype - individuals who are equally skilled in thought as they are in execution and can be measured by impact.

            Like many topics in this blog, I enjoy contemplating the big unifying theories. Pervasive topics with elusive truths - the sort that if I could merely glimpse a semblance of an answer for it - would help me to rationalise the world on a meaningful scale. I find solace in thinking and intepreting what this means to me, my world view and eventually thinking &ldquo;yea that makes sense&rdquo; when aliens invade one day. No surprises.

These are a wide and varied bunch to get through&hellip; Bolded ones prioritised (deemed doable). Its a shame for the others - I find that I have forgotten the sprightly thinking and ideas behind a few draft posts.

            A heavy title - Ah my friend Finitude, we meet again.
I have not fallen sick since November 2021, and to fall ill recently allowed myself to stay in an entire weekend. Sensible - given an upcoming trip to China.
This post serves nothing more as Sunday night reflection.
Doing more I have been terribly grateful that my health has been in good shape. A post-Covid lockdown health report tells me that I merely need to take more Vitamin D, and that the rest of my test results are superbly fine.

            As a (temporary) closure to the series of posts on education, I stumbled across Kurt Hahn. Who coincindentally, was also a founder of the high school that I went to (UWC).
He is regarded as a Great Educator. But its an obsecure term, and I&rsquo;m not familiar with what a &ldquo;Greaet educator&rdquo; meant. Its a little more relatable in other fields. A great Scientist; a great Chef for instance. But what does it mean to be a great educator? The number of students? The impact - both personal and academic?

            And off that last post on Children, I dug up yet another related post in the backlog.
This serves a partial book review on David Brook&rsquo;s the Road to Character.
*Afternote: gosh its been more than year between reading the book and actually posting this. *
On Character As remarked in the previous post on education I see the need to manage ourselves well (Life-led) as equally important to academics. This is something that cannot be directly &ldquo;taught&rdquo; in a school, but I believe it to be critically important as the world becomes ever more complex, uncertain and complicated.

            There is a increasing trend nowadays of people in my generation that don&rsquo;t want children. Climate change, and not being able to give them the best are often cited as reasons - but I struggle to completely wrap my head around it. I don&rsquo;t believe this choice is rational one at all, and points towards deeper emotional reasons.
Its a challenging question and a topic that crops up, and so, in line with the purpose of this blog (sinplifying complex questions into distilled answers/ framework), I discuss it here too.
