            In my previous post on political structures (it&rsquo;s been quite some time now), I described a basic framework/spectrum that helped me understand the general overview of such a complex topic.
But we live in an age where democracies are still highly relevant and prevalent. Indeed, the Benevelont Dictatorship (ahem, where I&rsquo;m from) is still technically a democracy.
So the next question is that how these political structures survive (or not), as the stability of such structures are subject to the whims of fragmented, disparate constituents. And yet, the balance of benevolence, governance and politics must surely be the equivalent of tightrope walking on a wet, windy day.

            As a self-identified generalist, I often think about the use and meaning of considering specialisation.
Its also a topic that has come up several times with my peers - many of whom are generalists too, by virtue of starting my career in a primarily general area. I&rsquo;ve noticed that this critical decision (binarity of choices), suffers from the Grass-is-greener on the otherside complex.
The Generalist feels insecure and the lack of definition on the value of their skills and their transferability.

            I recently revisited sthe concept of intuition. I&rsquo;ve been holding on to a strong belief that intuition comes with a certain wisdom. I&rsquo;m not saying that intuition is better than logic per se. But I believe there&rsquo;s a natural progression where people transition from idealistic logic to a matured form of quality &ldquo;intuition&rdquo;.
Just like wine, I see the complexity and irrationality (difficult to describe) as a natural conclusion for people who start to make sense of things but ultimately realise that our minds are simply unable to comprehend and decide across spectrums and the myriads of possibilities

            In my previous posts, I had endeavoured to bring clarity to myself on the complex topic of Energy. Having written this amost a month apart - I hope there isn&rsquo;t too much repetition - though if there is: it serves to underscore the areas i feel terribly strongly about.
I had also touched on the point that I have seen multiple narratives, and the noise in this field.
Complex Problems with No right answer We can recognise a complex problem exists when a caste of &ldquo;Thought Leaders&rdquo;, bringing with them: varying passion and vitriol emerges with different views. Energy is no doubt one of these battlegrounds, with LinkedIn as its combat zone.

            This post mirrors one that I had loosely outlined about sustainability (which I now can&rsquo;t find).
These are complex topics, but its directive principles can be reduced down to: 1) Increasing the efficiency of impact vs consumption and 2) reducing consumption
Though when it comes to energy, I think I can afford to go into a bit more detail. And I&rsquo;d also like to explore a nuance on the point of reduction if technology is able to catch up.

            My last post lightly covered the general energy trilemma framework. I noticed that there are slightly different definitions around the same thing; though I&rsquo;ve adapted Arup&rsquo;s one. First because theyre reputable as engineers, and second, because I really like the use of the word &ldquo;security.
The Energy Trilemma encompasses a balance in affordability, sustainability and security. &ldquo;Trilemma&rdquo; is a great word, as it captures the inherent trade-offs between them all, as I emphasise this again.

This post was triggered by this immensely interesting interview by egon zehender with ed Schein (that popped up on my linkedin feed. He happens to be the biographer of my former workplace&rsquo;s management strategy.)
As a consensus builder, I recognise, and take pride in my strength to bring people together - acknowledging and communicating trade offs where possible.

A philosophical post as a I find myself, tired, occupied and worried over numerous journeys in the last week. Being out of one&rsquo;s homeland, being out of one&rsquo;s comfort zone, being forced to deliver and achieve (but by whom - is yet another philosophical question).
This post was spurred once again by my good friend, my best friend. Who in the path of solace, had begun to unravel the mysteries of the self.

            Peace has historically been dictated by the control of a power singular hegemon.
Examples: pax Romania, pax Mongolia, pax&hellip;
The stability of the hegemon confers benefits. The ideal state of a wider market, leading to improved trade, consumption, employment, enrichened culture in theory brings all under its influence to prosper. This continued prosperity promulgates further stability.
However, with the free market within its hegemon comes competition. And with competition (no doubt having the hegemon benefit the most) comes inequality. And so it is the hegemons role and existential challenge to maintain harmony within its own domestic borders, as much as it is with its own allies.

            Retirement has been a topic recently. Cropping up in some conversations.
Certainly not applicable for myself at this hustly career focused stage. Neither am I an immediate proponent of the Financially Independent, Retire Early movement. I suspect the inner survival instinct and drive will lead me to continue to work.
Instead, the conversations are centred around myself and my peers whose parents are entering the zone of retirement.
It also ties in to some recent 2023 planning (which could be a post in itself - though slightly curated for a truly public version. There are hidden areas and desires of oneself that I&rsquo;d keep close to heart)
