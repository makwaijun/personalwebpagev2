On Love Specifically, it has been celebratory time with the family - a big milestone / event happening for closed loved ones. Indeed, while there were some tragedies earlier in the year - with the old, comes the new, and so the cycle continues…
But in the pursuit of truth and overarching frameworks - Love is one of those everlasting mysteries, like life, art, and what goes into mcnuggets.

            Ah Millenials. I mean Millenials as I picture an old fellow spittling away with a brusque sneer: A pittance of morality; lazy, arrogant foolish.
I keep seeing viewpoints how different generations perceive one another - with one baby boomer generation ruining the world into purgatory, and the second millenial generation squandering wealth and its perceived nurgatory (subsequent generations are too stuck in their phone games to matter in this debate&hellip;until they&rsquo;re able to infleunce votes).

This post summarises my take/framework to understand political structures Disclaimer: I like the one I am under currently. — A Singaporean and an American walk into the college bar. I remember bringing up the phrase a &ldquo;Benevolent Dictatorship&rdquo; - as the craft beer seeped into the recesses of my brain and dug up this phrase that I saw once, somewhere, sometime. (I don&rsquo;t think I was clever enough to come up with it on the spot, drunk enough perhaps). The next thing I remember the immense laughter and incredulity. But is it incredulous? Every election season (well, of the US), or perhaps every time there is a China vs US fear - Political structures and ideology is always fun topic that will pop up everywhere. Democracy vs authority! Left vs right! Socialism bad! Same shit, different year (aside from the top 10 reasons why this one is different.

            As a matter of building off previous posts, and to ensure the &ldquo;permanance&rdquo; of content amidst numerous evolving conceptual ideas, I&rsquo;ll add some additional ideas / thoughts through separate posts. This way, if there are interesting articles I read along the way that are relevant to a past post, I&rsquo;ll add a commentary such as this one.
Recently (clearly not today, as I am hardly able to maintain a regular time to write), I came across an article by the New York Times by Peter Coy discussing how big boy pharma companies are making bank (well specifically, profits) off the pandemic.

This post calls back to an earlier post written off thoughts I&rsquo;ve been engrossed on over the last 3 years. Specifically, on the increasing role of Sustainability and its emergence as an Economic Chapter in its own right. It is nice to have recently read articles by industry movers and shakers which reflect the same.

            TLDR;
This post seeks to present how I have made sense of the long term struggles against inequality, and why it is so difficult to crack. There are four pillars of inequality - International, Domestic, Absolute and Perceived An absolutely critical theme that runs acrosses many of my posts - economic, education, political and sustainability - sees inequality as a focal point that must be addressed to unlock progress. In other words, if there is a single node that connects many of my posts together - inequality would be one of the largest by number of connections.

            TLDR:
I reflect on my time working for the government. I reflect on four principles that modern governments can consider for modern times. The Great Exception: There are structural challenges in being a minority in a small country Trade-off mindsets: There is too high a fixation on the myopic &ldquo;best /better&rdquo; decision, as opposed to a holistic view accounting for trade-offs. Bursting the Bubble: Public Officers should engage deeply in the &ldquo;real world&rdquo; and avoid being trapped in a bubble. Wacky socio-economic Eugenics: This could include mixing the public - private occupations of families All rambly thoughts are my own. Pls dont sue T_T. In the first phase of my career, I spent around 3 and a quarter years working in the Singapore Government. This post serves as a reflection on what I view as several underaddressed key concepts that underpin the tensions of our time that I observed in the civil service (ie not covering the political nature of governance.)
