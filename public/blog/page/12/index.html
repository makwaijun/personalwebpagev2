             TLDR: There are several tools that can be helpful in forming your own view on a sustainability subtopic. The Back of the Envelope approach and Lifecycle Analysis (LCA) can help us assess the practicality of green solutions, and to make fairer comparisons. This can help make us more informed in our decision-making, whether as a consumer or advocate. All that glitters is not Green. In my last post, I discussed some elements that can help us make better-informed decisions on the issue of sustainability. While purchasing more green stuff is certainly well intentioned, misinformation or greenwashing can easily cause more harm than good. Its better to try out your own calculations and assumptions, and to decide on which positions makes the most sense.

             TLDR: Sustainability is a process of self-discovery; I break down my own journey into distinct stages; I use it as a framework to understand where others might be on this journey; I hope it provokes deeper and more critical thinking on the issue. In my last post, I spoke about my observations and opinion on sustainability as a concept. As an extension of these observations, I will now share my observations and analysis on how we, as individuals, can approach to sustainability in different ways.

            TLDR;
Sustainability is a multi faceted, complex issue that fascinates me. It has many different interpretations and requires an intimate understanding of how the world works. There is a danger of sustainable development falling victim to its own complexity. It helps if we were more informed and nuanced in our understanding of it. Disclaimer - views are my own. There is no one way to think about sustainability. Some of this thinking is shaped from my background in engineering (i.e. technocentrism). I must also confess myself a cynic. (see my older post about how my views have been shaped here). This post is also designed for those not directly in the sustainability field&hellip; Although I would argue that there are some &ldquo;sustainability experts&rdquo; who I disagree with, for the reasons below.

            TLDR; I reflect on how best to make use of this blog; This will set the structure and purpose of the blog moving forward. As the new year breaks, I have decided to give this blogging exercise more direction.
After reflecting what - specifically - I would want to share with prospective readers, I felt that something unique (and therefore of-value to others), was how I have come to perceive and understand the world. Especially so, given that the topics I am most interested in are complex and multidimensional&hellip;and not quite the day to day topics that you can learn about in a short amount of time.

Through reading, synthesis and systems thinking, I offer my own take of the state of the world . This is not meant to be prophetic.

            TLDR; Geographically, Singapore lends itself to trade. Singapore has a rich heritage of merchants and traders. The Merchant mindset prefers to take, and not make. This puts Singapore at an inherent disadvantage to create value. As the economy grows more intangible (article for another time), this also skews us towards a profit-without-product state. This is not resilient or healthy in the long-term. But things are temporal - cultures take time to change. History of Singapore&rsquo;s Role in International Systems Since the late Medieval Era, merchants ranging from China, Europe and the Middle East appear to have engaged with the settlement based on historical records. Archaeological evidence points towards Singapore (or Temasek as it was known then), as a trading centre and a fortified city.

            TLDR; I live by a belief system of living in the gray. Nothing can ever be linearly explained. There are complex reasons and interrelations behind everything. It has made me more tolerant of different views, as I seek to understand both sides of an argument. This belief system crumbles when I come across an extremist view. I can&rsquo;t tolerate this. This leads to a paradox: Can a belief system promoting tolerance coexist with one is unable to tolerate intolerance? The Background One of my core beliefs that came out of my lessons in Systems Thinking (reminder to tag/link here) was that the world can never be depicted in black or white.
