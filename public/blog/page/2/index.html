            Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;m neither a fan of Financial planning nor accounting, and there isn&rsquo;t really a reason to do this first aside from the fact that it is the end of the year, and I&rsquo;d like to follow a similar thought process for my own personal &ldquo;Budget&rdquo; in 2025.
1. Set Revenue Guidance and Target (Sales Budget) Sales (preferably grounds up) to review opportunities and pipeline to hit figure Current view is having opportunities, 2. Understand Key Enablers (Sales and Marketing) Consider what are needed to achieve the target Manpower Marketing (especially exhibitions, campaigns, advertisements, promotions) Travel, transport, entertainment 3. General and Admin (OPEX) General management Manpower General expenses Travel, transport, etc 4. Product (OPEX) Split by each respective Project team Consumables Services Note that some product development expenses can be capitalised, but I have found masking such costs are not tenable in the long term, from a &ldquo;purists&rdquo; view of P&amp;L.

            In 2021, I wrote two series: based on my thoughts around Sustainability and around economics. In 2022, and perhaps a sign of my interest diverting away from thinking about the external world, but into the internal realms, i started to write more about life, human nature, and career.
I would certainly say that 2023 was quite heavily oriented around work (and I am somewhat self-impressed that I managed to write 27 posts). As I started typing this, and its already almost the end of October with only 6 posts uploaded.

            As the year draws to a close, and the annual dusk settles, there is a quiet moment (undoubtedly helped by being on leave) to think clearly and clearly think about thinking.
I am reminded on this blog&rsquo;s reason for being, and its Reason for being as well as the ability to improve the learning and synthesis process, as I find myself far too spread out in interests and in the &ldquo;must-dos&rdquo;: from an engineering background, to a fascination with socio-economics, geopolitics, and the humanities; and now I teeter on another crest - waiting to fall into the arms of Cyborg form of Athena. Wisdom personified, but enabled by nanotechnology this time. Moreover, I find myself professionally engaged (scale ups aren&rsquo;t so straight forward), being an Executive Committee member of a trade associations, and an Officer Commanding, while the wine business (events these days) hums in the background.

            On Fear and Death The sort of post that anyone who thinks too much for their own good, must eventually tolerate and write.
It was warm, friendly, if slightly unfamiliar setting; the scent of cheese and red wine, good conversations and banter. Rather Jovial. Up until, someone probed - on what one&rsquo;s greatest fear could be.
Common fears bandied around the table included death (which was later clarified as the awareness of death), insignifiance (or legacy, as I term it), loneliness (which again, was discussed under the context of the solitude and highly individualised experience of one&rsquo;s own death)

            A travel note from a work trip to London in September 2024
A trip of many firsts: First time being a solo &ldquo;travelling salesman&rdquo;, following up with in-person meetings.
First time driving in the UK. First time renting a car in a long time.
The trip was layered: less of the Ifs and Whens, but rather, the buts. One of repeated crisis and things that could go wrong, but turned out for the better (or minimally and ok)

            Background: booked a surfing camp at Kimasurf, Sri Lanka had recently gotten out of a foreign currency crisis. Decided to document quick travel notes
I remember fuel being topped up while car is running, which blew my mind. And the initial expectations on the struggle and crisis were not very apparent. Lights were on, and things were indeed moving. There were numerous signs of the legacy of former development, whether it was related to old British colonial vibes, or international business. Japanese school languages and Japanese companies, a Montessori Childcare, a Cargill and Keel concepts with large strip mall carparks that reminded me of the US.

I dropped by the Porsche museum. On a weekend. In between work days.
But the visit comes at an interesting time.
First, from an external perspective, the glitz and glamour around the autmotive industry in Germany is under siege. Struck by multiple whammies of weakening domestic demand, and the rise in Chinese automotive (cheaper, and better) products, while navigating a long-drawn and immensely costly energy transition.

            The year 2024 was one intended to be slightly regressive. Emphasising other aspects beyond the romanticism and suffering of impassioned work. But, life tends to drop hints along the way, and I find myself a little overwhelmed with the ever accumulating &ldquo;Extra Curricular Activites&rdquo;.
As far as I enjoy the multiplicty of experienes, its more difficult when everything is new. There is only so much, and so little capacity one has within a year to adopt.

            Another antiquated set of notes (likey 2021) dug out to refine and complete, finished on 21 Oct, in the skies above Karamy, on the way to Hamburg from China
It started by stumbling across two rather separate wikipedia articles, while thinking about inspiration, and muses (and musaea, a post for another time). Both sparked an observation on the topic of Resilience - from an entity standpoint.
The Two Libraries of Antiquity&hellip; Libraries have been the primary institutions of knowledge management institutions in antiquity. Great libraries could very well have been the ultimate amalgamation of humanity&rsquo;s knowledge at that point in history. A scholar&rsquo;s wet dream.

            Another ancient draft post dug up. Time to recall and dig up the memories&hellip;.
Thoughts and Preamble Some thoughts i had before going in:
Solitary Quarantines are a strange thing. It made me wonder - for people of my generation these days, how those conditioned to hyperstimulation would be able to handle it. Also considered that solitary confinement would seem far more punishing on the human psyche than at any point prior in history. I also approached it with a sense of experimentation, and how i would take it. Background I stayed in the Mercure Hotel. Which was nice, as a business traveller hotel. If i rememebr correctly, we stayed for 14 days. I was with my CEO at the time.
