            TLDR:
I frame Education through a its aim to i) Conform to social requirements (social responsibility), and ii) Living Well (Individual responsibility). Ending tuition intuitively helps minimise domestic inequality - but the issue is far more complicated than it seems. In my last post, I wrote about the western glorification of the Asian education system, and tried to paint a fuller picture on the pros and cons of different systems.

And I never have been - aside from a couple of volunteering stints here and there. But every now and then, I come across two running commentaries that keep popping up on the topic of education.
First, is a narrative that lavishes praise on the academics of some Asian countries, including China, Korea, and Singapore. Often, it prompts self-reflection in Western media, probably stemming from a fear of competition, or soul-searching on how they might do better.

Moving out has allowed me to: Rediscover and taking ownership of my wellbeing and creativity Been an important bulwark against ennui Recognise (more accurately) my finanncial and quality of life needs March 2021, a young man with a metabolic age ten years younger than his actual age (thanks boditrax), finally took action that has been weighing on his mind for years&hellip;
I, after much deliberation, moved out. Perhaps it is not the place here to articulate fully on why I wanted to. Suffice to say - and I don&rsquo;t think it is unusual - there is just this &ldquo;thing&rdquo; when young adults who have lived abroad return to live with their parents. Perhaps it was the nostalgia of a time that was less complex (just study, graduate, get a job), more exciting (can do whatever you want) and for the first time, escaped from the influence of figures of authority. I could have affixed blame to living with my parents as a the reason preventing me from reliving those moments, when in actuality, life has changed and its time to move on.

Why we might reach a steady State From a systems point of view, there is always an aspiration that one day - the cycles will cancel each other out - that things will moderate - thus reaching a natural equilibrium. That is, until a significant external force once again reshapes
During a time of crisis, is when we . A pandemic, such as COVID, would have undone lesser civilisations with ease. Indeed the plagues of the past all led to severe social upheavals, and permanent revolutionary reform.

The Determinants of the future economy (within decades) Through my past role in Strategic Planning, I have come to be very fond of a tool called Scenario Planning - a systematic way to look at how the future might play out. I definitely do not have the time or capacity to do this exercise in entirety, but are several major forces that remain uncertain to me, that will shape the economy of the future.

As marketing becomes the key differentiator in a world where material functionality is commoditised, there is a real risk of pervasive bullshit (I am yet to read a seminal piece on this). Yet, in the pursuit of growth, capital will continue to flow to such areas. This I term, as the rise of the &ldquo;Nonsense Economy&rdquo;. It is the new frontier of rent-seeking behaviour, and detrimental to the economy. If you have been following my previous posts, I sum up many observations which culminate into a phenomena we see today.

            TLDR;
There are reasons to believe that the previously described trends may not hold true in the future; The gravity of economic activity is shifting away from tangible products, to intangible services. This shift presents big challenges for modern economies - many of which are yet to be addressed properly. Things are Changing As earlier described, from a cyclical point of view - the world is at an inflection point of great change. Further complicating this, is an unprecedented development, effectively rewriting the rules of the game. This is:

            Before I continue on, I wanted to touch on another helpful model to rationalise why we see so many changes, disruptions, etc during these times. Thinking in cycles is a good reminder that what is bad, has been bad before; and what has been good has been good before. History is a powerful teacher and Change is one of the few consistent truths in life.
The importance of Thinking in Cycles Here, I reflect on the importance of thinking in cycles as a way of understanding the world in a rather emotive way before I get into the meat.
