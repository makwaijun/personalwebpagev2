            &hellip;Which I think is a natural question that follows.
Looking at the business cycles and the criteria I had laid out to define what a dominant economic activity looks like - I foresee two new chapters emerging in the short term.
Sustainability Quantum If we described quantum as the new “digital”, and sustainability as a necessity, I am fairly certain of these trends.
Neither should really be a surprise, though I believe they are still too nascent in my mind to be considered a full chapter at this stage. Sustainability may see it becoming dominant in the next five years, and quantum, after that.

            Consolidation and Monopolistic Tendencies - Examples As each Chapter matures, champions emerge to control the dominant share of the market. By defintion, most of these are conglomerates, who have underwent significantly Mergers and Acquisitions, as identified in the Consolidation stage of each industry.
Some examples are listed below:
Chapter 2: Resource Development Oil Majors: Shell, Exxon, BP, Conoco Philips, Total Chapter 3: Manufacturers Western Industrial Conglomerates: GE, Siemens, ABB Chapter 4: Global Trade Global Freight Forwards: DHL, UPS, Fedex, Nippon Express Chapter 5: Modern Services Advertising: Big 4 - WPP, Omnicon, Publicis, Interpubli Accounting/ Audit: Big 4 - EY, KPMG, PWC, Deloitte Consulting: Mckinsey, Bain, BCG Digital Western: FAANG Chinese: BAT Platform (CURRENTLY UNDERGOING!) Grab Uber Gojek + Tokopedia Organisational Restructuring in Companies Royal Dutch Shell was principally an oil discovery and extraction (Resource development, Chapter 2) company - at least around the time they merged. Since then, they have essentially developed in accordance to each Chapter of economic development.

            TLDR;
Economic Chapters are not static. They follow cycles. Each chapter has implications to how businesses are structured Each chapter has implications on how jobs are valued In introducing the series I highlighted that there were two ways to look at economic chapters. The first being the approximate patterns and trends observed at a high-level giving rise . This was explored in detail in the first two posts.
The second is the inherent messiness and dynamism that drives “Evolution” within each chapter. This post will elaborate more on this.

            TLDR;
This post elaborates on some patterns and observations looking across several economic chapters. These are the principles that guide how the theory of economic chapters work in totality. New chapters are emerging at a faster pace. New chapters are additive to its predecessors and are not inherently destructive New chapters are complementary to its predecessors. This has led to increasing permutations of where value is created and applied. PREMISE 2: Trends and patterns can be spotted across chapters.

            TLDR;
This post gives some further texture to what I define as each Economic Chapter The Chapters in Detail Applying a bit of artistic flair (in my very roundabout wannabe-a-humanities-student kind of way) to illustrate each chapter, I attempt to convey:
Representative personas of success (e.g. the archetype of success at that time, with the exception of the ruling class) Rough timestamps to help anchor each chapter in a time period of human history*. Rough idea of what the key differentiating factor was in that age. *These mental flagposts are not intended to be scientifically accurate and assume a period where the chapter&rsquo;s predominant activity becomes widespread across the world. I concede that there are some natural discrepancies here, as economies developed at different rates.

            TLDR;
Economic development and technological advancement across mankind&rsquo;s history can be framed as &ldquo;chapters&rdquo;. Chronologically order, each Chapter highlights the dominant economic activity of its time. This was/ is the ultimate driver of job creation, profits, and innovation - core aspects of any economy. PREMISE 1: GLOBAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CAN BE BROKEN DOWN INTO SEMI-DISCRETE SEGMENTS On one hand, the global economy is an enigmatic force.
It is constantly reshaping - creating and destroying wealth, lives and countries. Yet, when looked at from a historical perspective and if abstracted to a high-enough level, patterns also emerge. Therefore this first Premise supposes that the global economy has evolved (constantly changing) over long periods of time through certain somewhat-discrete eras - defined here as “chapters”.

            Over the course of the last couple of years, and in part due to my time working in Singapore’s Economic Development Agency, I have since developed a fond interest in the economy/ field of economics.
In this context, I generalise and speak about the “economy” simply as anything related to the way value is exchanged. Going deeper, this topic touches on a wide range of concepts - economic history, firm competition, human behaviours, labour, government policies - all of which carry an incredible depth in their own right.

Nah, this is just a transition post, carry on. The series of posts on sustainability surfaced several open questions, which will be explored in the upcoming posts - albeit not directly. I will just let this hang here as a reminder of how the domain of Sustainability is linked to that of the Economy.
The fracturing of cohesiveness along lines of division (all kinds of lines, age, economic status, etc, etc)

             TLDR: I&rsquo;m a believer in effecting change at the system level and not the incremental. I elucidate on how I have made sense of the issue, my own reactions and the challenges ahead. These include buying stuff that lasts, and working in a field that intersects good business while doing good for the planet. Unlike the other posts which were more argumentative in nature, this post will be an amalgamation of thoughts and contemplations on how to progress sustainable development.

             Warning: this is more of an opinionated ramble. Do not expect an evidence based argument behind this. The title is clickbait - something I rue, but the intent is to make a point on this topic. TLDR: My view is that marketing and advertising is the real villain preventing a more sustainable world. I find it curious that many &ldquo;thought leaders&rdquo; and the activists shouting the loudest come from PR/Marketing/Advertising backgrounds. Whether sustainability or economic, I have generally viewed the marketing and advertising industry with disdain. There are two main reasons why.
