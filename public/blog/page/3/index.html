            On a flight back from the US to Singapore, dug out an old draft to see if it can be finished
It would appear its time for the annual post on Politics. Not terribly irrelevant, givent that Singapore will likely have an election this year too.
As a recap, my last two posts in this series explored:
The spectrum of effectiveness, which ranges from benevolent dictatorships to unfeterred democracy. An additional observation about people: those dispositioned to balance/intuition (aka Jedi) versus those who believe in absolutism (aka the sith) These were perhaps a broader on the high level reflections of the systems we see in the world, and the types of people who vote.

Moving to Obsidian After a scare (of dynalist logging me out randomly, and me being terrified of losing alllll my notes from many years).
I&rsquo;ve decided to move off Dynalist and move onto Obisidian (which, coincidentally, are made by the same developers)

            My posts over the last year and a half are riddled with mistakes.
It was a way to ensure productivity, especially at a time when I was less patient, and just more occupied with my heaspace on other things. I prioritised putting something out, or at least capturing the gist of the idea over correctness. Perfectionism is the enemy afterall.
That said, looking at my first few posts in 2022 compared to the posts these days&hellip;I can&rsquo;t help but feel a bit disatisfied with the frequency and egregiousness of some of the errors.

            This has been a post long stuck in &ldquo;draft&rdquo; form, given is complexity and breadth. Due to both mulling over a very abstract topic, and procrastination. I am a little more compelled to put it into writing today, as I wait, subjected to a 4 hour flight delay in a Lombok Airport (lovely beaches; learnt surfing). What better way to spend it then thinking about Economic Producitvity.
It is a complex topic, with its uses and critiques. I first came across the concept of Producitvity while working in the economic agency of the government.

            Based on my mindset in 2023, I note down some quick reflections and reviews on what I&rsquo;ve reflected on a slightly less than straightforward career so far.
A useful exercise to maintain perspective, especially given i) my high tendency for emotionally investing in work; and ii) consistent lack of clear targets and structure since the beginning of my career.
Conditions to thrive: Domain or thematic interest oustanding leaders Great team Hard work is fine, as long as its Good, honest Success and achievement Reflections on what I like to do - what makes me tick: Strategy big picture stuff Running organised, meetings and hitting meeting outcomes Being trusted, the closed door 1-1 meetings. Interviewing and hiring for character; Mentoring and getting the best out of people (interns) for now Things i dont like to do: Legal Accounting Making slides (I&rsquo;m aesthetically challenged) Curious (haven&rsquo;t done) Possible regrets: Overseas, structured experience, Working on a production line so as to truly understand the on the ground experience Product development Key areas to fully complete my skillset in 10 years R&amp;D and technology Production / operations Procurement The ultimate goal is to complete some level of exposure opportunities to optimise and thrive.

            Docmenting down some core thoughts I&rsquo;ve had in mind, based on my 6 year working experience so far. I could describe it as something slightly unconventional - most notably by taking early risks and still somehow throwing myself into places out of my comfort zone.
Some core lessons learned so far - while I still consider myself at a relatievly &ldquo;early&rdquo; stage of my career.
1. Entities can ofer a Spectrum of opportunities and trade offs Working in small companies affords high responsibility and little structure; possibly accelerated in pathway, but at the same time, brutally uncertain. Working in large companies can offer a stable and clearer but slower pathway Working in intermediates somewhere in between will exhibit characteristics of both.

            Indeed, one target in 2023 was to deeply review my personal relationship with my career. Well its the end of 2023 now, and I wouldnt say things are necessary peachy or rosy. The path is still gray: a rollercoaster of opportunity, failures, wishes, effort, lack of outcomes, tangibility, intangibility. And with this it makes it harder to swallow, when one feels to connected to the outcomes and success at work. Even more so - when many of these are not within one&rsquo;s control.

            I&rsquo;ve been into this field for a while. studied in 2016. now worked and wokring for two climate hardware technology startups.
Perhaps, for a topic so deeply rooted in noise, change and transition, its worth relooking each year to see how my views have (or have not) changed.
What has Maintained An Anti-catastrophic mindset I dont deny the issues, climate change is real, but I continue to maintain an antagonistic view against angsty activitists and doomsayers. Generally a lack of proper advocacy and inability to understand the trade offs hinders meaningful actions. Lots of loud noises, but unproductive.
