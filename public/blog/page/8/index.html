            I started cooking while in university. It started with the simple things.
I recall one of the proudest and most memorable. It was in a shared student dormitory kitchen. I was faced with the daunting prospect of either starving that night, or confronting my greatest anxiety of quietly cooking in a shared unsafe space. Intimidating for there was a group of predrinking first-years. The sort that you kind of know as your neighbour, but never well enough to properly socially interact with them.

            (Sunday, 1000) As I lay out by the beach today, crisping away in the sun. I have started to write again, a feeble attempt to catch up on the never ending backlog of ideas, thoughts and reflections.
While gorging myself on breakfast though - I read On the Tyranny of Having a Hobby by one Rosa Lyster. Well written, with a satirical tone of seriousness, about how something less serious should be indeed taken more seriously. Fantastically amusing.

            I was in the sea today. And saw the buoys bobbing. I set a target; an unconcious marker to swim to before returning to shore.
And while swimming, I we were boats, travailing on the open sea. But in the ocean - the winds buffet and blow. Mother nature is unpredictable.
And so we need an anchor. Or anchor_s_, as I shall explain:
Support systems There are many theories around us humans as social creatures.

            I met a good friend one night for dinner.
We were weary of work. A tired Friday night. And as commiserating souls do, we spoke about happiness. He asked &ldquo;one a scale of 1 to 10, how happy are you?
I paused and reflected, as one does facing a question of such gravity.
And I felt that I went a 4/5 to an 8 in two years.
1. Finding the North Star Clarity on purpose and meaningful work - but through a few bouts of introspection, I had essentially found a desire to find work that is mission-driven, Sustainability, currently, fell nicely within both of these segments. I drilled down further, as I had written in my career post, on the intersection between Hardware, Technology and Sustainability.

            Ugh this was a bit delayed (pardon the slight-out-of-orderness). This follows on from Post 64 (duh).
In this post, I add to my thoughts on the economy from a macro perspective. From the broad trends and history of the global economy, to intangibility and rise of bullshit transition, and finally towards contextualising economic development models for developed economies.
The world has undeniably been shaped by global powers and major economies - driving technology, competition and consumption trends. An anecdote - I recall finding a Chinese restaraunt in the middle of a fringe city (Teresina) in Brazil; while similarly being able to find Peruvian grocies halfway across its country of origin Singapore. Its fascinating and indisputably beneficial - surely.

            Its time for&hellip;yet another post on existence and being! A more reflective/philosophical post (ugh love these sort of things over drinks).
What is the meaning of life? perhaps not meaning per se - but something more deliberate. I recall one of my earlier posts, focused on survivalism and the like. But after some light brushes with religion, I had started thinking again around this topic.
I first feel that there is an innate struggle of man to overcome our animalistic survival instincts in favour of peace and acceptance. But what do we accept? Are what we accept objective truths or subjective perceptions? We, do afterall, live in a rather gray, asymmetric world. There are inumberable things to do and not do, and things unanswerable that a mortal lifespan will struggle to answer. But are some of these questions right or necessary?

            Preamble I am not economically trained and the thinking below could either come across as i) Bizarre, or ii) Obvious to those who read it. Welp, anyway:
It is indisputable (come fight me bro) that a good economy - is one that keeps people employed well and in meaningful occupations thus creating social stability in a country.
During the Post- WWII era, national economic development followed a strategem to bring themsleves out of poverty. It was reliant on developing countries integrating themselves into the global world order, building exportable skills, and carving out competitive niches to win.

            This is a predominantly personal post - naive perhaps in the public domain, but nonetheless important guiding points for future endeavours.
Having said the waffly part, this post will aim to be a bit more grounded, to draw down the dreams into the realm of reality and practicality.
Similarly, I shall phrase some of these as Tenets, and guiding principles that seeeeeems to have served me well within the confines of limited career thus far. To be snappy and not overanalysing, I&rsquo;ll write this as a list of useful pointers, rather than a continuous segment of words. Where I&rsquo;m able to, I find that some of these networks are linked to one antoher, in a self reinforcing virtuous system.

            Preamble: Background homework - Individual beliefs and values As a massive, hugeee prerequsite to thinking about how we feel about work must be developing an understanding and appreciation of our own worldviews. (instrospective mUcH?). It starts with aligning our definition of purpose with the actions we take (like work) must sense of life&rsquo;s ideology and what we deem to be more meaningful than others. Perhaps the thinking here may be thought-provoking - but never prescriptive.

            Preamble First of all, I am in a blessed position where I do not have to obsess about finances (the most relevant goal of work). Instead, I explore the more indulgent aspects of work, assuming we are able to put enough food on the table and live well. This is made possible with limited liabilities and a stable background, which I must remind myself not to take for granted.
This series pens down my personal thinking behind work and its meaning - to act as an mental anchor to be deliberate, wise and free to make sound choices in this impactful area of life. It is as much a doctrine for career planning; as much as it is a balm for my soul, easily lost in a sea of choices.
