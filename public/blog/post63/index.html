    <p>This is a predominantly personal post - naive perhaps in the public domain, but nonetheless important guiding points for future endeavours.</p>
<p>Having said the waffly part, this post will aim to be a bit more grounded, to draw down the dreams into the realm of reality and practicality.</p>
<p>Similarly, I shall phrase some of these as Tenets, and guiding principles that seeeeeems to have served me well within the confines of limited career thus far. To be snappy and not overanalysing, I&rsquo;ll write this as a list of useful pointers, rather than a continuous segment of words. Where I&rsquo;m able to, I find that some of these networks are linked to one antoher, in a self reinforcing virtuous system.</p>
<h3 id="tenet-1-the-performance-dividend---always-do-the-best-thing-always-do-the-right-thing">Tenet 1: The Performance dividend - Always do the best thing; always do the right thing</h3>
<p>For something that originated from a deeper need for validation, I have found that consistently putting in the effort, and doing the right thing with integrity pays back. People remember. And it takes the better part of our fallible human selves to preserve it.</p>
<h3 id="tenet-2-the-secular-holy-trinity-of-where-to-work">Tenet 2: The (Secular) Holy Trinity of Where to Work</h3>
<p>I tend to use a three-criteria rubric when making gut decisions on where to work. I suspect this could change in the future.</p>
<ol>
<li>Leader - To find inspiring leaders that spark a willingess in me to indenture myself to (I would goddam follow them to war), and to learn to be a better employee and person from;</li>
<li>Team - To find a team filled with trust, capability, and once again, inspirational characters;</li>
<li>Job - To find (more broadly) a role/function/ etc aligned to my purpose (See previous post)</li>
</ol>
<p>Naturally, all three may not be 100%, but it helps me frame what I am drawn towards.</p>
<h3 id="tenet-3-meet-your-liabilities">Tenet 3: Meet your Liabilities</h3>
<p>Be practical, and pragmatic. Appreciate that we all have our own liabilities to cover. In many cases, financial.</p>
<h3 id="tenet-4-multi-disciplinary-excellence">Tenet 4: Multi-disciplinary Excellence</h3>
<p>There is always someone better than you at any single field.</p>
<p>However, our value to the market can be defined by being in the top 25% of a range of (loosely) three or four areas. This blend of inter-discplinary capabilities (and to act on them), is how we can differentiate ourselves in a sea of talent. This implicitly involves acknowledging our own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>This is an application on my thinking around the additive nature of cycles, written <a href="https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post37/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="tenet-5-multiply-learning-through-attempted-entrepreneurship">Tenet 5: Multiply Learning through (attempted) Entrepreneurship</h3>
<p>Trying out entrepreneurship has been a great eye opener.</p>
<p>Where time and resources are availabe - running your own business (or at least building it) has taught a lot through the practice of doing. In other words, seeing the best practices of others in different roles, is best internalised through self-practice. Nothing beats learning than doing it yourself.</p>
<p>But such an experience need not be weighed by expectations of success - their is significant learning value kept within us, just by breaking even. Of course, a huge amount of effort and dedication is needed to ensure its not a wasted exercise. Afterall, how much we learn is a function of how much we put in. It is an avenue to fail, without the fear of judgement.</p>
<p>Moreover, it has also helped to develop a deep sense of appreciation in every other business and individual out there. This links to Tenet 4 - by exposing ourselves to different industries, communities, etc - often creats a new gem of value between the lines.</p>
<h3 id="tenet-6-multiplicative-door-opening">Tenet 6: Multiplicative Door Opening</h3>
<p>Upon embarking on a big career step change, I would always question whether it opens more doors based on industry, role, network, etc?</p>
<p>This is more true for those - like myself, in this current phase - who are in the earlier, rather than later stages of their careers. At some point, I still desire to specialise and focus in a specific domain(s). Similarly this helps to achieve excellence in Tenet 4 - this requires a balance of new experiences and deliberate learning.</p>
<h3 id="tenet-7-humility-and-growth">Tenet 7: Humility and Growth</h3>
<p>Learn from the bad - take mistakes head on, and learn from these;</p>
<p>Identify with the good - recognise and appreciate our strengths, particular to combat feelings of the imposter syndrome. I have chosen the word &ldquo;identify&rdquo; to internalise your strengths with how we view ourselves.</p>
<p>Never turn down a free opportunity to learn - even if it requires that 1 extra hour and that bit more effort. It would probably save or significantly improve your efficiency down the line.</p>
<h3 id="tenet-8-networks">Tenet 8: Networks</h3>
<p>Linked to Tenet 1 - Be good and people remember. Never burning bridges and keeping a wide network - perhaps driven out of curiosity is always a strong thing to tap on. Whether to gain or exchange knowledge (or value), or just for an added flourish to our own individual selves. I&rsquo;ve been blessed that Tenet 1 has compensated for my natural introverted disposition. I&rsquo;ve just stumbled on a thought that a smaller, but higher quality network can be built through honest action rather than directionless words.</p>
<h3 id="tenet-9-self-management">Tenet 9: Self-Management</h3>
<p>Many a time - as seems to be increasingly common these days working in startups - I have found myself neededing to manage myself a bit more (particularly true in Startups).</p>
<p>As an inherently anxious person that gets creeping feelings of shame and guilt (I have, indeed been conditioned very well) if I don&rsquo;t do work during working hours. I have used to define how to &ldquo;self-place&rdquo; myself in areas to contribute.</p>
<p>There are three areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>What needs to be done - if there is a fire, and its burning everyone - step in, or at least bring a bucket of water to fight it.</li>
<li>What you&rsquo;re good at - this may require a good understanding of the team dynamic, but could I offer to do the excel model while you do the talking? I&rsquo;d take that offer any day.</li>
<li>What you like doing - this is a double edged sword, I am aware of my tendency for thought and theory over a &ldquo;bias for action&rdquo;. But generally,</li>
</ol>
<p>Ugh if i had one more i could relabel this article with &ldquo;commandments&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;tenets&rdquo;.</p>

<p>As a massive, hugeee prerequsite to thinking about how we feel about work must be developing an understanding and appreciation of our own worldviews.  (instrospective mUcH?). It starts with aligning our definition of purpose with the actions we take (like work) must sense of life&rsquo;s ideology and what we deem to be more meaningful than others. Perhaps the thinking here may be thought-provoking - but never prescriptive.</p></p>

            <p class="font-weight-light mt-3"><h3 id="preamble">Preamble</h3>
<p>First of all, I am in a blessed position where I do not have to obsess about finances (the most relevant goal of work). Instead, I explore the more indulgent aspects of work, assuming we are able to put enough food on the table and live well. This is made possible with limited liabilities and a stable background, which I must remind myself not to take for granted.</p>
<p>This series pens down my personal thinking behind work and its meaning - to act as an mental anchor to be deliberate, wise and free to make sound choices in this impactful area of life. It is as much a doctrine for career planning; as much as it is a balm for my soul, easily lost in a sea of choices.</p></p>
