    <p><em>Sometime, in April 2023</em></p>
<p>I sit, at a Sue Hsiao Liu Dim sum restaraunt.  Comfortably, I am reassured that Alipay could infact work with a foreign card. I sit as a ethnic homogenous but an outsider foreigner, betrayed by the lack of language, in what is technically my ethnic roots (although arguably my ancestors probably didn&rsquo;t come from Shanghai necessarily).</p>
<p>But as I sit, bravely and alone out of my comfort zone - I catch myself often reminding myself of what the discomfort is for, and how being up to a challenge can be managed.</p>
<h3 id="on-coaching-and-being-a-coachee">On Coaching and being a Coachee</h3>
<p>As part of building up the systems, structures to enable the pursuit of my interests, I had sought a Coach. I think this field has gotten a bit more popular, and is something a little more recent in its used context.</p>
<p>But humanity has gotten very far without the concept of coaching in its modern sense, and I see it as an opportunity and undoubtabtedly, a privilege.</p>
<p>The first &ldquo;Chemistry &quot; session was just a kick-off, but nonetheless helped tp probe what exactly it was I was aiming or striving towards. I consider the aim and mood was less about the tangible goals in itself, but also about the thought process.</p>
<p>I thought a useful distinction was how Coahing sat on the periphery of mentorship (perhaps much more skill specific) and therapy (mental health).</p>
<p>But I do like the practice of coaching / coachee: its personal enough to investigate and explore one&rsquo;s own psyche and outlook on life; while also being systematic in its own way and approach.</p>
<p><em>Sometime, late in the evening, 3 July 2023</em></p>
<p>I sit out of my comfort zone and alone on a late night flight to Shanghai. There have been a few tough, and at times, intense days of late. Just a few days ago I was in Houston. I am embrittled by the jetlag, yet somehow concious and thoughtful enough.</p>
<p>I considered and dreamed of what success was and how it looked like; a cloud of thought floating above the wartron battlefied through the equally important pursuit of discomfort &ldquo;自找苦吃&rdquo;: it helps to know what its for and why.</p>
<p>As the ultimate north star, in the privileged pursuit of purpose, these thoughts coalesced around:</p>
<p>A goal of geographic and financial freedom,
with the freedom to pursue what is purposeful and meaningful with contentment;
through a life lived virtuously; supported by a life lived with quality.</p>
<h3 id="on-virtue">On Virtue</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed some of the most recent, intensely meaningful moments as exemplars of a feeling of an otherwise ill-defined concept of Virtue.</p>
<p>Such moments arise when I get the feeling of</p>
<p>Being trusted, with integrity and competence.</p>
<p>To be reliable, consistent and dependable; with action based on the principles and values that one holds close to heart.</p>
<p>To Care, taking kindness over niceness: the latter being more superficial.</p>
<p>Often times, these unveiled through heart to hearts and thoughtful exchange. It is both sad and true that such moments often emerge at times of stress, vulnerability, weakness, uncertainty.</p>
<p>Their ain&rsquo;t no growth without struggle as things go.</p>
<p>It leads me to feel accomplished in some way.</p>
<p>I hope to conitnue building and participating in such Cycles of Virtue, that virtue begets virtue; that doing good attracts goodness.</p>
