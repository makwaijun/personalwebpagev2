      <description>In my last post, I had a notion about whether patriotism can exist in metropolises.
The obvious counterpoint is Hong Kong. A raw demonstration of fighting for one&amp;rsquo;s survival.
Were these for individual reasons? A manifestation of youth unrest? Those seeking to protect what is familiar and the current way of life? I am not sure.
In any case, it did set the scene for a contemplation about my own identity.</description>

      <description>The blog is born If what I do is common - I tend to read the latest few posts and first post when visiting a new blog. So I hope dear reader, to make this count.
It took the better part of one and a half-ish days over the long weekend to get this up and running.
I had been mulling for a long time on having my own personal website.</description>
