      <description>[Scope] Web Project 1: My &amp;ldquo;Lifestack&amp;rdquo; One of the projects I intended to host on this website was a visual representation of my intellectual (?) progress. This is in line with my first post, which spoke of the need to better understand my learning journey that has brought me here today.
It is meta-project that addresses its very conception.
Originating the Idea I studied sustainability, which got me interested into system dynamics and complexity science.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s post lays out some blog topics that I have been ruminating over for a while.
More subtly its another way to(hopefully) commit myself to a deadline before the end of the year.
Opening Thoughts I am glad that I have managed to have kept posting over the last few days. Gotta keep the momentum going.
I would imagine readership would be a good way of keeping motivated. Butttt thats better left for another time.</description>

      <description>Update Another week - another revision.
Welcome to version two of site - rebuilt from scratch with a generoues does of customised appropriated snippets of code.
This guide in particular was helpful in laying out the groundwork from Hugo.
Still fairly minimalist, but I have much better control and understanding of where the various elements are situated.
Key take-aways from this session were:
 A slightly deeper understanding of the hugo framework.</description>

      <description>The blog is born If what I do is common - I tend to read the latest few posts and first post when visiting a new blog. So I hope dear reader, to make this count.
It took the better part of one and a half-ish days over the long weekend to get this up and running.
I had been mulling for a long time on having my own personal website.</description>
