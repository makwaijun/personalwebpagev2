### Investment Philosophy

1. Buy when a stock price drops for a stupid reason
2. All about the mid-term game. Somewhere between fast trading vs dividend investing
3. Mid-term game is predicated on fundamental trends which i feel are irreversible:
   1. National security and defence. Rising protectionism and nationalism.
   2. Media consumption. With basic human needs met, most growth will not be in conventional productivity (tiny incremental, until quantum), but rather around the innovation of ideas, and capture of attention
   3. Sustainability. Things gonna get hot and more volatile. 
   4. Downside mitigation as women give birth when they are older.
   5. Aging population
