Home is docile, eyes closed, napping.  

Unalarmed by movement, 
of rustles in a jungle of warmth and pillows.  
Pillows and peace. 
A familiar sound mumurs.

But I do not stir.  


Home is the white noise as I lay there, body still.  
Bones fatigued, mind tired.  
A form disembodied from the soul.  
It could leave and never return.  

But I do not fear.  


Home is the silent sizzle and steam from the kitchen.  
Of material and immaterial needs met.  
Of things wanted and things taken for granted.  

But I do not hunger.  


Home is the existence of being there, vulnerable, without fear of judgment.  
A heart left unguarded on the hearth.  
Unpressured to awake from my dreams.  
To dream widely.  
To dream openly.  

and dream on, I do.  


Home is reminiscence when in another world, a planet away.  
It is the shadow lingering 'neath eyelids in the dark beyond.  
Home is a reminder of the better things there had been.  
And the better things to be.  

So I do not despair.
