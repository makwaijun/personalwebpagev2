Grey smattered sky,  
Howling, blowing  
waves crashing,  
Palm leaves snapping. 

 
Trunks tough and sinewy.  
It's colossal structures cracked.  
 
But I embrace 
the sky's sharp spittle  
as a timely reminder,  
That I  

In the awe of nature, THAT nature  
Never ceases to amaze  
Never ceases to destroy  

when the rain flowed horizontal  
Saturated with energy.  
Feeling alive.
