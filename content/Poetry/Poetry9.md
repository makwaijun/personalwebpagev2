I jogged along a well built path - music accompanying my ears.

A path paved in a park - natured and forested;

But i noticed a loud cluck, from the right

and jogged past a

rooster, a hen, a hen, with chicks beside.

&nbsp;

My brain wandered to consider

What if the Chicken fell into the gutter?

Can it can fly out by itself? 

A prisoner of its own mistakes, perhaps 
chickens help each other out

&nbsp;


What if the rain came:

Like tides high and low

Yellow leaves become a muddy flow

To drown or survive as poultry


Unrealising a timely doom

The slow dread

Of being locked out of a room

&nbsp;

Perhaps we too,

Can only look out at the gutter

And pray it doesn't rain 

As my legs jog step by step,

the chicken takes a short flight.

*Mood: Out for a jog in west coast park, on a weekend afternoon*
