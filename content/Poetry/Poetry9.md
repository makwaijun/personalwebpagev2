I jogged along a well built path   
(music accompanying my ears).  
A path paved in a park   
(natured and forested);  

But I noticed a loud cluck,  
(from the right)  
and jogged past a  
rooster, a hen, a hen,  
(with chicks beside).  

My brain wandered to consider:  
(as it does)

---

What if the chicken fell into the gutter: 

Is it prisoner trapped,
of its own mistakes,  
Or perhaps chickens help each other out.  

---

What if the rain came:  

Like tides high and low,  
yellow leaves become a muddy flow,  
to drown or survive as poultry.  

Unrealising the immidnent doom,  
like the slow dread  
of being locked out of a room.  

---

Perhaps we too,  
can only look out at the gutter  
and pray it doesn't rain.  

As my legs jog step by step,  
the chicken takes a short flight.
