Waking at just the right time and place  
Focused on enjoying the moment  
Not tarrying or rushing  
Embracing rest and nestled in its sweetness.  

Fighting off the creeping pressure to descend.  
But remember I don't. And neither do I dream.  
Instead, 
I think thoughtfully  
But in a boozy clouded way  
Not to slumber,  
But feel the texture of the bed.
