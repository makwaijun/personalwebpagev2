Waking at just the right time and place  
Focused on enjoying the moment  
Not tarrying or rushing  
Embracing rest and nestled in the wholeness of its sweetness  

Fighting off the creeping pressure to REM  
But remember I don't. And I don't dream.  
I think thoughtfully  
But in a boozy clouded way  
I don't slumber.  
But feel the texture of the bed.
