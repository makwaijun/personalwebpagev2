Waking at just the right time and place
<br/>Focused on enjoying the moment
<br/>Not tarrying or rushing
<br/>Embracing rest and nestled in the wholeness of its sweetness
<br/>Fighting off the creeping pressure to REM
<br/>But remember I don't. And I don't dream.
<br/>I think thoughtfully
<br/>But in a boozy clouded way
<br/>I don't slumber.
<br/>But feel the texture of the bed.
