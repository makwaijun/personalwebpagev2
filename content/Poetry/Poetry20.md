In the  

Hamburg  

Blue-Skyed Morning  

Sleepy wind swept streets  

Layered by autumnal colours   

Yellow, orange, gold and concrete too  

Red hued bricks of towers and apartments  

The highest-earning mercantile region of Germany.  

My heart beats 93, unsure if it's the city walk or anxiety  

While I hop across cafes with wifi, power and activity   

Nourished by good coffee and ingredient quality   

Gazing inside-out at the shimmering waterfront  

Keeping apace on autumnal leaves  

Before the dreary gray descends  

Gray clouded evening   

Before tomorrow's   

Storm.
