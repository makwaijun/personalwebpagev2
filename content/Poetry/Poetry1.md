What is poetry but a succinct diary, tapped on a phone, to the rhythm of the mood,

Oft tired, lethargic to move, but restless too under the hood.

It is the mild soothe of an informal dialogue from oneself to myself.

A mirrored retelling of spirited pleasure and the laments of misery.

A cheap therapy paid for by the purse of vocabulary.

&nbsp;
 
It writes itself, (in bed with no light, 

bound in a hoodie on a 6 am flight.)

with thumbs creeping across the keyboard briskly,

desiring to capture the precise moment-thought-feeling

of that time, that place:

Imbibing the essence of space,

imparting the spark of emotion, 

imprinting the colour of scene,

impounding the beats of heart.


Feelings that inevitably get clouded by the whats-beens, and it so must in equal part be, 


A requiem for the moments gone, a rite for memory's curse: 

For the purest truth of feeling is irreplacable,

despite the gift of verse.

&nbsp;

My silent companion, my guardian of reminiscence.

Over azure skies, I fly through the dusk into an uncertain dawn. In gentle remembrance of the whispers of the past.
