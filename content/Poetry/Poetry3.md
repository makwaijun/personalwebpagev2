"You're so cute"  
she continues,  
"But I'm married", she says  
Her hands grasping.  
First innocuous, then closer and closer.  

Brought to her dress.  
Smooth as silk.  
A mere film between something cool  
and something warmer.  

Doe eyes look upwards  
to match mine with a measured intensity.  
Blushed cheeks nearing.  
A sweet mouth primed for the lean in.  

She, perhaps torn inside,  
but to the night's chaos she trusts.  
I, perhaps torn inside,  
suppressing the innate lust,  

searching for the appropriate response and answer  
while the tension and time ticks.  

---

A flame of passion melting the wax, stoic,  
First a simmer, then a burn,  
down to the wick.  

What is right and wrong mulls the body and mind,  
with afflicted faculties blurred  
by the whims of whisky and wine.  

To tarry to the bar in reprieve for another drink?  
Or to surrender to the moment  
and indulge in another's kink?  

In the candle-smoke, I suffocate.
Clouds of discipline wall me in,
A prisoner of my own irrational morality.  

As my kingsized bed greets me  
the next morning, empty.
