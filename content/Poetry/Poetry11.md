I watched an old man play bejeweled <br/> for his first time.


Peered through the gap in between the two airplane seats, <br/> through half closed eyelids, <br/> as I drifted and lulled between conciousness <br/> And a half awake mind

&nbsp;

Like a voyeur peering through a window into the,<br/> Human phenemon of encounter and discovery, 

&nbsp;

His leathery hands waved over the touchscreen,<br/>
to commence, entranced with wonder <br/>
through his foreign eyes, that saw not the language
<br/> but symbols and shapes

&nbsp;
Wrinkled fingers manoeuvred deftly,
<br/>Guided by blind intuition, 

&nbsp;
As they traced over the jewels blue blue orange
<br/>Down a column
<br/> To no avail 

&nbsp;

And green green purple
<br/> across a row 
<br/>To no sucess

&nbsp;

And several more times 
<br/>to no gain  

&nbsp;

As i quietly wished for his realisation
<br/>of the goal
<br/> to reach three-in-a-row

&nbsp;

The subtle arrows and hints never seen
<br/>and in-the-end, 
<br/>the pattern never spotted

&nbsp;

But just as efficiently and gently did the fingers 
move.
<br/>Did they too, glide over to the menu
<br/> and so,
<br/>left the game

&nbsp;

Pointless, 
<br/> 
And trophy-less in knowledge.
 
&nbsp;

My eyes roll back into its shades
<br/>
and I pondered sadly
<br/>
whether we learn slower
<br/>
and learn less as we age

&nbsp;

Oh, the futility to learn something that didn't need to be (twas' just a game) <br/>

Or perhaps there is just a satisfaction in knowing or unknowing 
<br/>In the attempt and trial
<br/> Without the final point in mind

&nbsp;

and of those benign minutes of
<br/>flight time passed
<br/> Is not a bad thing. 
<br/> Is it?
