I watched an old man play Bejeweled  
for his first time.  

Peered through the gap in between the two airplane seats,  
through half-closed eyelids,  
as I drifted and lulled between consciousness  
and a half-awake mind.  

---

Like a voyeur peering through a window  
into the human phenomenon of encounter and discovery,  

His leathery hands waved over the touchscreen,  
to commence, entranced with wonder  
through his foreign eyes,  
that saw not the language  
but symbols and shapes.  

Wrinkled fingers manoeuvred deftly,  
guided by blind intuition,  

As they traced over the jewels   
— blue blue orange —  
down a column  
to no avail,  

And green green purple  
across a row  
to no success.  

And several more times,  
to no gain.  

---

As I quietly wished for his realisation  
of the goal  
to reach the fabled
three-in-a-row.  

I lament the subtle arrows and hints never seen,  
and in the end,  
the pattern never spotted.  

But just as efficiently and gently did the fingers move.  
Did they too, glide over to the menu  
and so,  
left the game.  

Pointless,  
and trophy-less in knowledge.  

---

My eyes roll back into their shades,  
and I pondered sadly  
whether we learn slower,  
and learn less as we age.  

Oh, the futility to learn something  
that didn't need to be  
(twas just a game).  

Or perhaps there is just a satisfaction  
in knowing or unknowing,  
in the attempt and trial,  
without the final point in mind.  

And of those benign minutes  
of passed flight time.  
Is not a bad thing.  

Is it?
