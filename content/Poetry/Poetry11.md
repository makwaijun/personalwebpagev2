I watched an old man play Bejeweled  
for the first time.  

I peered through the gap in between the two airplane seats,  
through half-closed eyelids,   
as I drifted and lulled between consciousness  
and a half-awake mind.  

---

Like a voyeur peering through a window  
into the human phenomenon of encounter and discovery,  

As I watched,  
His leathery hands wave over the touchscreen,  
to commence, entranced with wonder.  
Wrinkled fingers manoeuvred deftly,  
guided by blind intuition,  

and not  
through his foreign eyes,  
which saw not the language  
but mere symbols and shapes.  



They traced over the jewels   
— blue blue orange —  
down a column  
to no avail,  

-green green purple-  
across a row  
to no success.  

And several more times,  
to no gain.  

---

I quietly wished for his realisation  
of the goal  
to reach the fabled  
three-in-a-row.  

I, breathe held, watched the subtle hints never seen,  
the clues never noticed     
and in the end,  
the pattern never spotted.  

But just as efficiently and gently did the fingers move,  
Did they too, glide over to the menu  
and so,  
left the game.  

Pointless,  
and trophy-less.  
Defeated but not forgotten.

My eyes rolled back into their shades,  
and I pondered sadly  
whether we learn slower,  
and less as we age.  

Oh, I lamented,  
the futility to learn something  
that didn't bore no consequence  
(twas just a game).  

Or perhaps satisfaction  
can be borne from the  
 knowing or unknowing,  
the attempt and trial,  
without no point in mind.  

And of those benign minutes  
of passed flight time:  
It wasn't so bad.
