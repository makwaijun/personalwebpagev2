### I Bid Farewell,
With "best wishes"; "Good lucks"; "You will be fines".  
The subject of memory, the consequence of time.  

To have grown up with the world, heartstrings tugged afar.  
Heartwrought pacts written in greetings of morn,  
that fade into dusk and sunk into muddy tar.  


But today I pledge and today I honor,  
the moments spent, the troubled pains.  
These I somberly relish,  
not knowing the paths b'crossed again.  

Inked as short inscriptions  
into the annals of the mind.  
Old tales whispered from neural crevasses  
that none will ever find.  

These I scrawl on sepia parchment  
with a heart under reticent duress.  
Succinct as it should be.  
Not a second more and not a moment less.  

Til we meet again at that wedding or funeral.  
'Tis hard to wish for the next  
serendipitous travel.
