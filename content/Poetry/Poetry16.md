Art for life and art for livelihood,  
or Art for Art's sake.  
Free of judgement and necessity.  
Unbounded and Unrestrained.  

Art for strife, or Art for mood,  
or a thirst to slake.  
Free, except for the cost of being human.  
Uncertain and Uncontained.  


*Completed 28 sept 2025, thought about poetry, art and creation. *
