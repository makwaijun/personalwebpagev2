In the twilight quiet  
The loudness appears  
Whistles and sirens echo  
with ten thousand fears  

I see a trainwreck due  
With no corners to turn  
I watch my self wake  
Just to see it burn  

It burns my ego  
It burns my pride  
It's the taste of defeat  
of an inherited demise  

I stand on a deck afore  
A nightmarish scene,  
On a catamaran called "Hope"  
As a First mate, then Captain  

Who rose up to the challenge  
Before sinking down below  
Bearing a burden, heavy  
Not of a chest laden with gold  

Instead weighed down  
by the conscience  
Of others' and my own,  
As I wish for this night to end  

And for a tomorrow to never start
