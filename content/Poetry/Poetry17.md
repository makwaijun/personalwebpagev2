Beneath the veneer of invincibility  
The cracks and fractures belie  
Things that don't go swimmingly  
well, the faults and doubts arise  

This plan of plans  
Of great ambition and vision  
Subjects the mind to duress,  
The body to few-houred nights sleepless,  
A Soul starved of connection  

In its wake, leaving behind  
Heartache and disappointment,  
the essence of which  
Tremor and quake with  
Caffeinated heartbeats  
and bloodshot eyes  

Which, then gaze forward,  
To the next Hour by hours,  
and day by days,  
To crack on to the next morrow.  

For this path was freely chosen,  
By this weary author  
Who did consider and conclude that,  
for the price weighed in tears,  
And the faults well considered,  

A stake has been claimed  
in my partial being   
but not yet my entirety.
