To crave the connection.  
Through a picture. Through words.  

Embattled with the foe fantasy  
and dreamy irreality,  

Snapped, by the fear  
of the first confrontation,  
a terse dance subtly masked  
and masqueraded with the play of tongues.  

But it is with the same subtleties  
of which I shyly approach.  

Who, how and where are you?  

This deviance in the monotonous,  
a star taking flight,  

Descends on an ethereal horizon;   
chained to the sight.  
Its brief existence a snapshot,  
captured by desirous eyes.  

Open, I leave, the door   
for gratuitous visitation rights  
to a heart enclosured, and  
fortified mind.  

But it is not to be  
a modern romcom stomp,  
whose beats subside to a  

Prim indifference with no nook of calm.  
No warm balm, but just the skin-touched  
Cold fabric, sheets soulless,  
unrested under covers.  

And so alone I drift  
in a dreamless realm,  
at two inn the settlig twilight.  
So sleepy, is the sunrise.
