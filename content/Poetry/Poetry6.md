To crave the connection.  
Through a picture. Through words.  

Embattled with the foe of fantasy  
and dreamy irreality,  

Snapped, by the fear  
of braving the first confrontation,  
a terse dance subtly masked  
with misdirection and the play of tongues.  

But it is with the same subtleties  
of which I shyly approach.  

Who, how and where are you?  

This deviance in the monotonous,  
a star taking flight,  

Descends on an ethereal horizon;  
a snapshot captured by desirous eyes  
chained to the sight.  

Open, is the door for gratuitous visitation rights  
to the enclosured heart and fortress of the mind.  


But it is not to be  
a modern romcom Stomp,  
whose beats subside to a  

Prim indifference with no nook of calm.  
No warm balm, but just the skin-touched  
Cold fabric, sheets soulless,  
unrested under covers.  

And so alone I drift  
in the dreamless realm,  
at two at the settling twilight.  
Sleepy is the sunrise.
