To crave the connection. Through a picture. Sometimes words. 
Embattled with the foe of fantasy and dreamy irreality,

Snapped the, by the fear

of braving the confrontation, a terse dance subtly masked with misdirection with the play of tongues - 

But it is with the same subtleties of which I approach thee, and it is to thee I speak.

Who, how and where? 

This deviant in the monotonous, a star taking flight.

Descending on the ethereal horizon; an ornate shrine for the mortal soul, the moment captured with desirous eyes chained to sight. 

It wills an open door of gratuitous visitation rights to the enclosured heart and fortress of the mind.

An atypical modern romcom Stomp, whose beats subside to

Prim, pomp with no nook of calm. No warm balm, but the

Cold fabric, sheets soulless, 

unrested under covers, 

And so alone I walk on in the dreamless realm.

Only to revisit at two at the settling dusk. 

Sleepy is the sunrise.
