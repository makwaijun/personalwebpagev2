I wear suffering like a badge of pride.  
A bastardised reversal  
and refusal to minimise pain.

I flirt wildly with the precipice,  
never far from the discomfort zone.   

Its to Grow,  
the voice says.  
But at what point does something give.  
At what point does something take.


*reflections on the growth mindset. Not without its challenges*
