We are, but inquiring souls, adrift in the great cosmos

feeding on a diet of parented Wrongs and society's Rights;

Yet born we are, with critical minds, souls yearning for liberation,

In a world 

where actions and choice are but illusions,

and in happenstance: Self-righteous delusion. 

&nbsp; 

In the lonely dark, afraid no longer,

Armed with a confidence forged from doubt and fear: 

It is true, it is right!

They must listen, they must hear!

&nbsp; 

Black, black - does the doctrine swirl,

Ink on paper, opinions to unfurl.

Rise, rise - does the conviction grow

They should believe, they should be compelled to know!

&nbsp; 

Profound in substance, blind to compassion,

A villain's truth is to fix a world in need of correction.

For the music of harmony is no longer fair, 

but a curtailment of speed and progress,
for a utilitarian's care.

&nbsp; 

Heroism is but to seek corroboration from the masses,

written superfluously by unjust kiss-asses.

For whom is the ultimate judge, but oblivion and god,

to smile at the devil, while the angels laud.

But care we not, for the majority lack will,

It is hard to enact change with little harm and little ill.

&nbsp; 

So why not change the world, if you could? 

For Villains are Visionaries, misunderstood.

*Commentary: Written in March 2024, on a prompt about Villains. It explores the theme of how heroes become villains. Core reflections are the development of how we are taught what is right or wrong (parents, school), to understanding there are no right or wrongs in some instances, to forming very strong beliefs on what is right, and thus a villain is born. 
The prompt mentioned entering a "Villain Era", which I can sort of identify with. Growing into a leadership role inevitably runs into unpopular choices and decisions, and I find myself prioritisng harmony less than i had once done, in favour of speed and assertion.*
