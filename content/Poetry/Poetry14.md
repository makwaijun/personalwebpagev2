Green grasses  
Sift with the breeze  
Girlfriends nagging boyfriends  
to take pictures  
Of luscious greens  

Quibbles and quarrels  
Laughter with love  
The simplicity of coupleship  
Basked in warmth from above  

*Written in a Suzhou garden with a university friend and his girlfriend, Summer (june) 2025*
