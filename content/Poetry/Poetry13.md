Breathe  

for Oxygen's sweet caress  
through a hollow sinus  

its hallowed chambers sacrosanct;  
that no medicine, no pills, can absolve  
To instead pray, I pray  

That, and  
The itch in my throat  
Just meatbags, liquid and air  

Why does it constrict and bind me so,  
to what end does this serve?  

Fatigue and all, I can understand  
but the stuffed up nose, I do not comprehend  

Powerless, I rage, in delirium  
a fever in both illness and feeling  
into the never-ending night  
til my breath silences and cools.  
and the cruel rise of the sun  

*Background: caught a cold and stuffy nose, Nov 2024*
