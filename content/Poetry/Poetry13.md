Breathe

for Oxygen's sweet carress
through a hollow sinus

its hallowed chambers sacrosanct;
</br> that no medicine, no pills, can absolve
</br> To instead pray, i pray

</br>That, and 
</br>The itch in my throat
</br> Just meatbags, liquid and air


</br>Why does it constrict and bind me so,
</br>to what end does this serve?

</br>Fatigue and all, I can understand
</br>but the stuffed up nose, I do not comprehend

</br>Powerless, I rage, in delirium
</br>a fever in both illness and feeling
</br>into the never-ending night
</br> til my breath silences and cools.
</br> and the cruel rise of the sun

*Background: caught a cold and stuffy nose, Nov 2024*
