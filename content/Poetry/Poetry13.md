I long to Breathe  

for Oxygen's sweet caress  
through hollow sinuses  
its hallowed chambers sacrosanct;  
that no medicine, no pills, can absolve.  

  
So instead pray, I pray  
For deliverave from   
The itch in my throat:  
Why does it bind me so,  
to what end does this serve?  

Fatigue and all, I can understand  
but the blocked cursed nose,  
I do not comprehend.

Powerless, I rage, in delirium  
a fever in both illness and soul  
throughout the never-ending night    

Aquiesced I lay,  
to a being, merely of  
meatbags, liquid and air  

til my breath silences and cools.  
It's rhythm forgotten,   
Only to realise when I stir  
to the cruel rise of the sun.
