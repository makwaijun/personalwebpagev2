You don't call the ambulance  
but the fire brigade  
to go out with a bang  
In a bonfire of passion  

You don't call the Devil  
to negotiate your plight  
but stand firm on life's lessons  
Taught by fear and pain  

You don't call God  
but the ones who matter  
to surround oneself with love  
because they were there too  

There. Here. And now.  


*Partially inspred by "Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night", by Dylan Thomas, and a reminder of what truly matters at the end of the day*
