Words few, nonchalant,

Cool but warm,

With high cheek bones and a cute buttoned nose.

&nbsp;

And that foxy eyed gaze

perched above a thick-lipped mouth,
that says,

I'm not here to talk, 

but to allure
in a silent mystique. 

&nbsp;

Svelt, like the waters, i've travelled to, with a hidden role,

That lays bare an independent and private soul,

to corroborate with the realisation that, 

She's a human but a cat. 
&nbsp;
