Words few, nonchalant,  
Cool but warm,  

With high cheek bones  
and a cute buttoned nose.  

And that foxy eyed gaze  
perched above a thick-lipped mouth,  
that says,  

I'm not here to talk,  
but to allure  
in a silent mystique.  

Svelt, like the waters I've travelled to,  
with a hidden role,  
That lays bare an independent  
and private soul,  

to corroborate with the realisation that,  

She's not a human but a cat.
