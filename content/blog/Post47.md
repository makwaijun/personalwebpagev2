WIP - recompiling for flow

This one goes ham on conjecture



### Why we might reach a steady State

From a systems point of view, there is always an aspiration that one day - the cycles will cancel each other out - that things will moderate - thus reaching a natural equilibrium. That is, until a significant external force once again reshapes 

During a time of crisis, is when we . A pandemic, such as COVID, would have undone lesser civilisations with ease. Indeed the plagues of the past all led to severe social upheavals, and permanent revolutionary reform.

Modern since World War II has presided over more wars, conflicts and more... yet at the aggregate level, the system has proven surprisingly resilient. There are global governance models, checks to ensure balance, channels for discourse for citizens, countries and more. 

Or am I missing the subtle changes? 

The world quite simply must be trending to a better place. Current expectation/ desire deals with exorbitant profit as a goal.

### What might the future hold?

#### Scenario 1 - Embraced Inequality

As free money flows and a bifurcation between the have and have nots happen. 

Struggles against inequality in the past have had mixed results. It's not a new problem.

Basic income provided

But controlled consumption. An economic system dictated by completion at the top, but control at the bottom.

The elites will fight over how this discretionary spending is used.

Is this wrong or right?There is an endless debate that could be had on the pros and cons of collectivism and invidiual free will.

Would UBI and directed consumerism suit their needs?Individuals who are free to do whatever they want (within the usual legal system of course) but with an added requirement to consume X amount of something per month?Think a group of powerful executives. Controlling what kpop bands manufacture. To enrapture a mass demographic. Who affix their value and life to this.Religionisation or cultitisation of the economy.It'll work for some. But not all.Unlike the indentured servitude that many dystopian literature portrays -Productivity is accrued to the elite.

#### Scenario 2: 

Opt-in, Opt-out system

Living and sustaining modern is diffifcult. 

But already in this day and age. There are just as many people who don't want to be in the "rat race". 

Gesellshaft - societal contribution to pla in this. this is the socio-economic impetus.

### Why we might not reach Steady state

Condorcet:The steady state is opposed by concoreocet. He says humans can infinitely progress.

Pro-cycle and the never ending strife:Dark ages between civilisationsFermi's paradox

Can human progress be unlimited?The limits of human mindHumans forget.Pro-progress and the steady state of humanity.

### Scenario 3: Never Ending Conflict and Fermi's Paradox.
