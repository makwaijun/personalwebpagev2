-   The steady state? As free monet flows and a bifurcation between the have and have not happen. Struggles against inequality in the past has had mixed results. It's not a new problem.
-   Basic income provided
-   But controlled consumption. An economic system dictated by completion at the top, but control at the bottom.
-   The elites will fight over how this discretionary spending is used.
-   Is this wrong or right?
-   There is an endless debate that could be had on the pros and cons of collectivism and invidiual free will.
-   But already in this day and age. There are just as many people who don't want to be in the "rat race". Would UBI and directed consumerism suit their needs?
-   Individuals who are free to do whatever they want (within the usual legal system of course) but with an added requirement to consume X amount of something per month?
-   Think a group of powerful executives. Controlling what kpop bands manufacture. To enrapture a mass demographic. Who affix their value and life to this.
-   Religionisation or cultitisation of the economy.
-   It'll work for some. But not all.
-   Unlike the indentured servitude that many dystopian literature portrays -
-   Productivity is accrued to the elite.
-   And so the cycle continues,..
-   ADD IN:
-   Can human progress be unlimited?
-   The limits of human mind
-   Humans forget.
-   Pro-progress and the steady state of humanity.
-   Steven pinker.
-   Condorcet:
-   The steady state is opposed by concoreocet. He says humans can infinitely progress.
-   Pro-cycle and the never ending strife:
-   Dark ages between civilisations
-   Fermi's paradox

-   Gesellshaft - societal contribution to pla in this. this is the socio-economic impetus.
