In a jumble of thoughts, I'm kicking off a series of posts on my world view starting with the last.  Funnily enough, the further away the timeline, the more "certain" the concept is in my mind.

#### TLDR;

- The future will be dictated by the most important race of humanity;
- The result of which will determine where humanity will exist on the spectrum between utopia, dystopia and extinction. 

#### The Rat Race of Humanity

Races.

Races in Ancient Rome, races in an ancient-er Greece. During the Olympics in the modern era. In betting booths across the contemporary world.

There are great races at every stage in your life.

The solitary sperm that raced against millions of its kind to create you. 

Individuals will themselves, against much discomfort, to climb great corporate ladders. 

Competitive corporates pitted against their incorporated competitors to innovate, be first to market, reach the next xillion consumers...

Countries too, race against others to develop and exploit what they can from the earth. However, many compete against their own history to develop and break free of an endless cycle of poverty and to break the middle-income trap. 

As I write, countries such as China want to get rich before it gets old.  

#### The Rat Race of the Planetary

But many of these races are but a small piece in a much bigger puzzle.

The earth needs to unify before our planetary constraints run out, or self-destruct as resources become scarce.

The question is whether this is best done as a collective. Or by the few, who by unknown means, end up with greater power over their fellow human beings. It is also worth thinking whether the modern man has overcome its primitive and feudalistic tendencies. Recent trends and events suggest not.

Unfortunately, this is where the information ends. Fermi's paradox, which notes the contradiction of a scientifically high probability of other life in the universe and the absence of it could very well point to the unpleasant but possible truth.

Intelligent life is often too clever for its own good. Nature has a way of correcting things. It may end up correcting us.
