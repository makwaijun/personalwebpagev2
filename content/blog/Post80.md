Just...a note that I came across this [article](https://www.protocol.com/climate/tech-workers-quitting-climate-jobs) from a Sustainability VC investor. 

It notes the move of talent from conventional big tech companies towards climate tech. 


Conforms to my framework on [economic chapters. ](https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post38/)

The best talent switching indstries? - check!
Additive fields (i.e, Climate + Tech) - check!

I love picking up reinforcing data points and patting myself on the back :) . Tastes like Cherries.
