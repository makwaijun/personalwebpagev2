Life update - just started a new job, in the sustainability field.

#### TLDR;

- Sustainability is far more than a codified definition orbiting "saving the planet" and tinged with green.
- It requires an intimate understanding of the world and the interconnected, complex systems within. 
- It is a something that every individual will need to discover for themselves.

Sustainability is (thankfully) huge these days. Not a week goes by where there is a major headline on something sustainability related. Not a day goes by without new investments or initiatives in the space. Not a minute ticks on where the importance of the issue is diminished. 

The sheer scale on the challenge is an interesting to me for two reasons. On one had, it is a powerful driver of human unification, given the common goal that we, as a collective species, need to work towards. On the other, it is terrifyingly frightful, that this could be the one issue that makes or very possibly breaks our civilisation. The past thousand years of human history point towards a violent outcome when it comes to resource scarcity...but I digress...

Sustainability is a top-of-mind issue amongst millennials. It is wildly popular, and I daresay "fashionable". Yet, the complexity of the issue demands a far deeper level of thought than one can simply make of shallow articles. Like many other social sciences, there is never truly one perfect answer, in a situation that demands serious **serious** trade-offs.

As a result, Sustainability is susceptible of falling into misinformation, unqualified opinions, and frankly - outright extremism. Like politics or religion, the issue is*:

1. Aligned to an inherent moral / belief systems (who *doesn't* want to save the planet)
2. Too complex to be explained by linear logic (As much as it pains me, climate science deals with error margins and probabilities that make it tough to be widely accepted by all)
3. The impact to the individual is largely intangible, and with no immediate effect.

**Note to self - revisit this in the future - is this a framework of conditions for issues that fall prey to extremism?*

A recipe for politico-socio-economic disaster? Yes - very much so.

> CAVEAT - views are my own and while I am never one to profess that I am correct, much of my views originate from my Engineering background (i.e. technocentrism) and general abhorrence of social media. Apologies for any offense in advance.

### The Journey

Whenever I meet someone who is interested in Sustainability, I like to assess where they are on their journey based on the depth of thought they exhibit on the topic. It does not correlate with age. 

It is a process of self-discovery, that can be separated in several distinct phases. 

Stage 0: The Precondition 

- Minimally, growing up in a middle-class background.
- Can afford food on the table.

Stage 1: The Awareness. (Introduction)

- The planet is fucked. 
- The reasons are fairly obvious, but heightened due to sensationalised eco-advertising.

Stage 2: The Interest and "passion" ()

- Humans need narratives and something to believe in. Sustainability is an irrefutably good one.
- Online research reveals a myriad of top 10 power tips on how to live more sustainably.
- There is a propensity to turn vegan or lacto-ovo-pescatarian or some other permutation of voluntary food choices.
- There are multiple demonstrations and displays of sustainable activity through various media. Such extreme passion cannot be contained within one person alone.
- There are like-minded individuals who validate the newfound lifestyle. 

Stage 3: The Frustration (Problem Identification)

- Somehow, despite the intensity of passion and community of like-minded individuals, the planet is still fucked.
- The immediate conclusion points towards stupid/bad people/systems intentionally harming the environment. These include, but are not limited to:
  - Politicians
  - All executives in large organisations
  - Capitalism 
  - The Patriachy
- But somehow its not about:
  - Budget travel to the Borneo jungle
  - The electricity and water you use to live a modern life
  - The electronic device you used to type your blog post on top 5 plastic substitutes.
- There continue to be numerous round tables, seminars, and talks that continue to validate such
- The rest of the world also does not do enough.

Stage 4: The Acceptance 

- To walk-the-talk, a job related to sustainability is found.
- With a livelihood now dependent on it, 
- 

Stage 5: The Transcendence 

### The Fallacy of the Narrative - Not getting stuck in Stage 3.

Narratives I say here, are designed to speak to the heart and not to the minds of individuals. Below are several overarching narratives which I feel are dangerously misguided. 

- Old vs Young (i.e. "boomers destroyed my planet")
- Plastic is Bad
- Anti- Big Oil Bigotry (there is more nuance behind this)
- Sustainable Fashion (and more broadly, Sustainable commerce)

### My Vendetta

Some are more misleading and even damaging to the environment than others. If I had unlimited energy in the world, - correcting misinformation in this area and inspiring people to move their thinking along the journey would probably be my calling.

Below are my bug bears at this point in time. I shall strive to write a dedicated post on these at some point (with evidence and Back-of-the-envelope calculations)

| Currently in Vogue                         | The resolution you don't want to hear                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Sustainable Fashion and commerce           | In general, consume less. Sate your soul with experience, not material. |
| Tote bags, glass containers, reusable cups | Locally-made, responsibly-disposed plastic is fine           |
| METAL STRAWS                               | More harmful than good to the environment, particularly if you use a metal straw less than a few thousand times |
| Meat and Air Travel                        | Price at a premium. Both cannot be "mass-consumed" within the planetary limits |

### The Requisite Path

The ideas shared here are not designed to convince or compel people to change their minds. My wish is for those at Stage 3 of the journey to see the bigger picture and channel their powerful energy into more productive means.

I implore all to understand the otherside of the argument and question why the (albeit broken) systems are there in the first place. If there is an idea that can alleviate pre-existing problems. 

Buying organic cotton shirts made by a villager in Africa and flown halfway across the world is simply not going to cut it. 

Which stage are you on?
