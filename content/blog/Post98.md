As a self-identified generalist, I often think about the use and meaning of considering specialisation.

Its also a topic that has come up several times with my peers - many of whom are generalists too, by virtue of starting my career in a primarily general area. I've noticed that this critical decision ([binarity of choices](https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post85/)), suffers from the Grass-is-greener on the otherside complex.

The Generalist feels insecure and the lack of definition on the value of their skills and their transferability.

On the other hand, the Specialist feels insecure at the lack of other experinces, and being trapped in their discipline.

No right or wrong in these situations, but what has helped me to choose a side it through understanding my own dispositions.

For instance, my identity as a highly curious individual about most things has aligned quite well with going down the Generalist pathways - for better or for worse.

### Pathways

The next question then, is how these principles can be applied especially for generalists. 

Specialists on the other hand seem to have it easier - just be really good at the one thing you do, and hope that it is commensurately value to the market too.

Often, I have seen my generalist peers take up roles in Business Development. Probably apt - as I've ended up in similar roles and can see where the curiosity and generalist skillsets can come very handy. 

I've also learned and indeed experinced the value of developing one's own network and connections. I hope to never have to be a faceless individual  on an electronic resume - skipping the nonsense and being referred in instead.

There are some roles that necessitates generalism in its full sense - General managers, for example, will need a blend of multiple skills, all rolled into one. 
But a comment from someone I shared this with raises an excellent question: It is then, difficult for an (externmely) introverted generalist to thrive or exist? I'm not sure - but despite being fairly introverted, theres clearly and element of being really easy to work with that has seemed to persist across my career. 

I think the eventual goal is to funnel innate curiosity into networks and experience. 

A good read on this was . I think its relevant to the above... although I can barely remember any of my main takeaways.
