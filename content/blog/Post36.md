TLDR;

- This short(er) post elaborates on some patterns and observations looking across several economic chapters. These are the principles that guide how the theory of economic chapters work.
- New chapters are emerging at a faster pace
- Each chapter is additive and complementary to its predecessors; This has led to increasing permutations of where value is created and applied.
- Subsequent chapters are increasingly intangible.

---

Looking across the chapters, there are three notable patterns.

1. New Chapters are being Written at a faster Pace
2. Each chapter is additive and complementary
3. Chapters have evolved from a focus on tangible needs to the intangible needs.

### The Pace of new Chapters

There exists plenty of commentary on how the pace of innovation is quickening. Some attribute this phenomena to the rapid exchange of information, as enabled by digital means.

To me, this is also driven by a drastic increase in business competition across multiple arenas (global vs local, technological disruption), thus leading companies to always want to *differentiate* - a concept I have written at length in the prior post.

### Additive and Complementary

Importantly, each chapter complements the preceding one in an additive fashion. New value creation can be found on the intersection of each of the chapters. To illustrate this, consider the following example:

Back in antiquity, you could have found a decent role to society as a manufacturer building tools for agriculture. 

Now, you may find a company or individual that is positioned with an advantage (differentiation) in: 

**Advising** (Chapter 6) companies on **Sustainable** (new chapter) **Supply Chains** (Chapter 4), for a **Mining** (Chapter 2) **Equipment Manufacturer** (Chapter 5), through a **Digital** platform (Chapter 7).

While societies may "value" the latter chapters more (as noted by the profitability of such companies), the prior chapters are by no means destroyed.

It is this realisation that has made me generally frame the rather intangible concept of how new jobs can be created even as old ones are made redundant.

However, this comes at a cost - particularly when there are an <u>increasing number of permutations</u> and buzzwords. Can an individual easily build depth an expertise as a two-chapter tool-manufacturer, or as a 7 chapter 

In the future, the hallmark of someone successful may very well be their ability to learn, absorb, and differentiate across multiple permutations, rather

This realisation has also made me intuitively believe in a shift towards generalists. It is not enough to build a deep skill in one particular area, but to apply them widely to each chapter and form. The more chapters - the more unique and valuable your skillsets could be to society. There have been books written about this phenomena too.

### The Shift from the Tangible to the Intangible

While the initial chapters focused on fundamental human needs (resource collection, manufacturing), the more recent shift towards a knowledge - based economy and now digital and so forth - mark a shift in how our economies value the intangible stuff over the tangible ones.

While there isn't a perfect frame for this, these chapters rather loosely track Mazlowe's Hierachy of Needs. Just as resource development like agriculture, or food manufacturing and processing met our basic needs for feeding ourselves in an affordable and affrodable way, I see many of the recent trends - in sustainability, mental health and more - focus on the intangible peak of Mazlowe's hierachy.

Again, these are additive. There is not a person who can be transcendental if their basic needs are met.

The framing of these chapters and its patterns have helped me frame how I view the economy. They have helped me, to a certain degree, rationalise how ridiculous how some things have turned out. But I suspect that there are reasons why this model is being fundamentally disrupted. These will be taken up in the next series of posts about the economy.
