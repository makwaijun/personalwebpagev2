At the Botanic Wachtler.

I remember when this website was born out of a feeling of a loss of control. Or a sense of helplessness that is felt during a once-in-a-lifetime (hoepfully) pandemic.

Change is an ever constant, and writing this when I have finally caught a berak overlooking what i believe to the be the Alps between Italy and Austria comes at a time when the human mind, my mind, is equally at risk of imploding in the too many 

*As a "catch up" of the year, the capacity has been stretched a little across: Leaning into general management responsibility (all problems are now my, and P&L problems), Being a Captain (loads of admin), being a student (part time, in materials science), Being a trade association exco (Industry development, not inconsequential), while keeping the space for family and friendships, and maintaining being an ever curious student of myself, the world and others*

It has been a huge half a year since my last post however. And I could prattle on with some reasons...largely reflected above: it is safe to say my mental capacity is, at times, rather stretched. 

But if a part of my brain has been adejusting towards the inevitable proliferation of AI tools in all facet of life, indeed, a part of my brain should equally be attentive to its independence of thought. 

As i had remarked before (LINK TO AI), the step-change to me, is for the first time, a body of knowledge exists that drastically accelerates access and capacity to knowledge in way that can connect the dots quickly. Such a resource takes "standing on the shoulders of giants" to another level: it is no longer a physicist standing on newton's shoulders. It is an entity that can have the breadth, depth and the polymathism of all the greats, of all of humanity's collective knowledge.

### Embracing the Grand Second Brain?
I embrace it however, as i actively need, and would like to solicit a powerful partner in life to keep track of the inumerable things in my mind. Things that i wish i could remember, delve in deeper, investigate further, within a finite life.

Indeed, one of the advantages (?) of documetnting a second brain is the possibility of developing an AI of myself (and protectively, for myself) both in a learning and in a functional sense. And (hopefully not in a chauvinistically named way, but), call on various assistants to help me compartmentalise and execute on tasks: (Nora for NUS school stuff; Amy for Army things, etc )

Things are made somewhat easier if I'm able to develop it based on the synthesis of all my content and notes, tracked and recorded on markdown, for security (one of the advantageous of Obsidian over Notion). An offline Grand Second Brain (GSB?) if you will.

### Without Losing Sight of the Self
But I must make a note, and commit, hope and wish that all of the content of this blog continues to be a product of my mind and my fingertips dancing on keyboards. A self promise, to preserve and maintain my own thought - even if it is no longer as novel or interesting in the face of an all encompassing entity, the self discovery journey must continue.

...except for proof reading, and the glaringly obvious mistakes, which I mayyy ask for help on.
