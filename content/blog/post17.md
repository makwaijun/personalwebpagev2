The steady state? As free monet flows and a bifurcation between the have and have not happen. Struggles against inequality in the past has had mixed results. It's not a new problem. 

Basic incomd

But controlled consumption. An economic system dictated by completion at the top, but control at the bottom. 

The elites will fight over how this discretionary spending is used. 

Is this wrong or right? 

There is an endless debate that could be had on the pros and cons of collectivism and invidiual free will. 

But already in this day and age. There are just as many people who don't want to be in the "rat race". Would UBI and directed consumerism suit their needs? 

Individuals who are free to do whatever they want (within the usual legal system of course) but with an added requirement to consume X amount of something per month? 

Think a group of powerful executives. Controlling what kpop bands manufacture. To enrapture a mass demographic. Who affix their value and life to this. 

Religionisation or cultitisation of the economy. 

It'll work for some. But not all. 

Unlike the indentured servitude that many dystopian literature portrays - 

Productivity is accrued to the elite. 

And so the cycle continues,..
