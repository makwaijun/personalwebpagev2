### TLDR;

* I earlier discussed issues of hype and the transition to the nonsense economy.
* My view is  that marketing and advertising does more harm to the environment than good.
* I find it curious that many "thought leaders" and the activists shouting the loudest come from PR/Marketing/Advertising backgrounds. 
* While it is important to surface these issues. The lack of science and rational information is easily misconstrued.
* This has led to more harm than good to the environment (and society)







Case in point, consider these:









["The City of Sydney, the central borough of the larger Australian metropolis, is now entirely on green energy."](https://electrek.co/2020/07/06/egeb-the-city-of-sydney-100-renewable-energy-arc-marine-reef-cubes-offshore-wind/ )

No its fucking not. Electricity =/= energy. Even so, saying 3/4 of energy is met by Wind and the remaining by Solar completely overlooks the issue of base-load capacity.





Solar could make up 43% of Singaporeâ€™s energy mix by 2050: study

now slyly editted to "Solar could meet 43% of Singapore's power demand during mid-day by 2050: study"



Worse still, these are written by journalists who are *meant* to be experts following the field closely!

Now, the impact could be harmless. At best, some people may feel good!

At worst, these are taken as examples and ammunition against the people *actually doing the technology*, who are repeatedly blamed for not (and the logic follows that they are sell-outs, want to preserve their oil & gas jobs, its a conspiracy etc etc)

I truly wonder how the general sentiment amongst activists believe countries can go with full renewable energy. A better understanding of the technology 

Looking back there have been all kinds of numberes.70%? 100% renewable? 

Individuals who probably don't understand how the devices used to spout more extremist drivel online are even being charged. 

Given this possibility, it must then be the fault of all others who are simply refusing to take the necessary steps to achieve this 100% goal. Clearly,
