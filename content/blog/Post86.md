### Control
As specks of mere startdust, i've come to readily embrace the idea that we cannot control many things, and recognising this is half the battle. Our decisions and actions, therefore must account for such uncertainities to the 'best available knowledge' on hand.

Call it stoicism, part of buddhism, but I carry the concept of 'Picking the right battles to fight' to be critical in maintaining sanity and stability when there can be much chaos outside of our sphere of influence. Things outside of our control and influence (as uncomfortable as they may be) should be accepted and digested quickly, as they can be red herrings and very distracting from action.

### Balance

It is of course, a balance between taking action based on whats curently within our control, as opposed to waiting or delaying action when the equation of control shifts. Control is a fickle fiend, constantly changing according to new information, an ever evolving complex system of interactions, and more.

I like to rationalise, define and express that concept of 'data points' - clear tid bits of facts that helps to inform and articulate decisions. Furthermore, this demands a rigor in collecting enough data points. Maybe three is enough to go off on.

As I've changed (matured?) over time to be an intuitive thinker unparalysed by ambiguous information, I often find myself holding myself back from action when there is only a single data points. I think the quality of action necessitates more (though not many) data points. 

I note that these are premised on tough situations and decision making (of which the startup lifestyle has certainly forged a lot of this), but I should relook this framework in the context of calm, peaceful times - when more patience can be afforded, and that I'm not carrying the 'problem solving' approach for decisions, not all decisions are problems.

And thus, it is a determined goal to find balance within the chaos of uncontrollable situatons - especially so when there are fires at hand. 

More mental models next.


Side note:  the greatest weakness of intuiton is communication. By definition, its inexplainable and irratonal to some, which can be a source of tension.
