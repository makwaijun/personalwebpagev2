In my last post, I wrote about the western glorification of the Asian education system, and tried to paint a fuller picture on the pros and cons of different systems.

While recovering from my second Jab, I read an [article](https://www.ft.com/content/0776243e-c4c8-4fc3-877e-119b1ed99b9e) that triggered a few thoughts on education. Since my last post was on education, well, I figured I might as well keep piling on some meat for this series.

I think its a great move by China. While I may not agree with its execution alll the time - the signalling is clear: China is willing to ruthlessly enforce what it believes is good for the greater society at large. I can admire and respect the decisvieness.  As an observer of the stressors of an unduly "kiasu*" system, I feel it could be a good thing in Singapore too.

**Kiasu* in the Singaporean parlance is a fear on missing out. More broadly, imagine an insecure, FOMO Chinese-traditionalist who is scared his/her kid's an idiot. Yup...the tuition industry thrives on this fear. If I had a kid, I too would be rationally fearful of ensuring my kid has the best chance of survival so to speak.

Caveat - while this is my second post on education, I am still neither an educator nor a parent, and hence the below is my un-expert opinion.

### Better Defining the Role of Education

But it begs the question what is education? Re-reading my previous post, I ought to refine my thoughts clearer on this.

I see it through two lenses:

#### Government - Led (Conformity)

The first is the ubiqutious "government-led" education system. Governments have their own interests which can significantly shape what outcomes they are trying to achieve through education. For example, language, maths, sciences, history, art are all taught to varying degrees, but governments and societies are able to shape which are "more valuable" for the purpose of contributing to soecities too. Ultimately it teaches kids to be good citizens, in the right context too.

Its good to be clear on what it is or isn't: 

- It breeds a conformity to a common system and to contribute to society
- It gathers people together in an environment where there may be "right" or "wrong" ways to act in a community. For example - throwing a chair is bad. Answering a maths question is good.
- It teaches a common language - the foundation of any stable society (not 100% effective mind you)
- It establishes what are seen as valuable skills or knowledge to be a productive member of society.
- It is also output focused - measured by metrics through exams oral and written. The key here being that such exams are *standardised*.

In a similar vein, this form of education would also be present in religious shools, or moral education camps (e.g. reeducation camps during the peak of communist ideology). These breed conformity, but in their own ways.

### Life-Led (Individualism and the Self)

The second, is what I would...for a lack of a better term, describe as a "life-led" education system. 

Unlike the "harder" skills taught in the government-led system, there are other critical aspects to life a  a productive life, but  There is just as much valuable knowkedge to learn in this area.

- Softer skills - such as teamwork, discipline, self-management and more, 
- Far harder to structure and systemise (hence the brevity)
- Immeasurable - the human to human and intrahuman interactions are far more complex to define what is  "rgiht" or "wrong". We spend most of our lives learning these I suppose. 

I think these are the types of learning education where, as the world becomes more complicated, there will be greater need and edcucation in this area.

### Ending Tuition...

Though I may have written it in a slightly derisive tone - I am completely in agreement with the fundamentals of a "government-led" education system. Indeed, I am a believer that societal stability, harmony and productivity stems from a strong education system that breeds a certain degree of conformity. 

My philoshopy has always been that a system of governance is all about trade-offs. It is unfortunate that not ALL people may fit well into the conformist system. One such example is the traditional argument being that an art-inclined individual may struggle or find themselves being deemed a failure in a STEM-oriented values system. But this, in a utilitarian view, is a necessary trade-off. If all human beings were left to their own devices, the structure of our community and societies would be very, very different. 

Having seen the calibre of teachers, and the general education system in Singapore - it is, in my view a good enough baseline. "All schools are good schools" is the oft-quoted phrase that has been a subject of debate and memes alike.

So why are we, as a society, compelling teenagers to undergo FURTHER conformity and standardisation through additional tuition? Can societies do more to level the playing field in an already unequal society? 

### ...But its Complicated

But its more complicated than that.

To be clear, I do not blame the parents (and certainly not the kids) on why things have turned out the wave they have. It is a race to infinity for parents to spend money and reosurces; and kids to spend their time hustling towards better grades. It is the right of the parent to invest in as much as they want for their child. I take no issue with it.

But there are several overarching issues complicating the matter.

#### Exposure to an internal schooling system

Can we compete (my instincitively answer is yes, but I am curious if there is data to show the proportion of individuals getting into top tier schools with, or without tuition)?

#### Exposure to the subseqent international Jobs market

Whether we like it or not, the skils and kowlege equipped must be on par, or above average to continue thriving in an open, globalised economy. How this manifests in the education system I am not too sure. 

### Exposure to domestic inequality

There are reasons why many scoff at the notion that "all schools are good schools". A healthy competition between schools, of course, can breed success

I am not terribly sure on what works - but I suppose minimally there should be similar budgetary requirements between all schools across the board.

Stakes are high though. Cutting the budget of an "elite" school is likely to receive a huge backlash from a more influential caste. It is the way of the world that such issues are yet to be broken.

### A Call for Top-down action

Overcoming many of these can't be left to societal norms. Again, it is a matter of priorities and trade-offs. 

But this is why many of the interventions have to be top-down. What if governments banned tuition for fundamenal subjects? What if governments promoted supplementary areas in areas of self-discovery and interest (ala my previous post)? What if governments (albeit unpopularly) deconstructed and reconstructed to truly make all schools EQUALLY good schools? 

I intuitively feel that this could lead to less stress for both children and parents alike. 

These are the kinds of shenangians that only a secure government can pull off. Indeed, it would appear that amongst the overarching issues - China is less concerned about its position in the international school and jobs market, but is more attentive to domestic issues - be it inequaity, dismal birth rates, and population unhappiness.
