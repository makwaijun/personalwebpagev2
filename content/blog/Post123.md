*Background: booked a surfing camp at Kimasurf, Sri Lanka had recently gotten out of a foreign currency crisis. Decided to document quick travel notes* 

I remember fuel being topped up while car is running, which blew my mind. And the initial expectations on the struggle and crisis were not very apparent. Lights were on, and things were indeed moving.
There were numerous signs of the legacy of former development, whether it was related to old British colonial vibes, or international business. Japanese school languages and Japanese companies, a Montessori Childcare, a Cargill and Keel concepts with large strip mall carparks that reminded me of the US.

The long roads and sheer walls of lush verdant greenery on both sides of a relatively pothole-less highway. Automobiles remain important.

A non -oriental sense of buddhism, that is a good reminder that its origins are inherently non-Chinese. 

An incredible sense of Sri Lankan hospitality and butlership; guards and military of the British heyday, but at a level of quality that has still retains a sense of pride.

Its people, responsible and hardworking, but perhaps not the best at multitasking (said by someone else but somehow stuck in my mind)

It would be nice to return, and see other things - the tea plantations and hills, the north east coast said to also be a nice surfing spot, the elephants and nature...
And its just about 4 hours from Singapore
