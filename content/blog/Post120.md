*Another antiquated set of notes (likey 2021) dug out to refine and complete*

It started with an observation. A metaphor based two wikipedia articles.

I first stumbled across it while thinking about inspiration, and muses (and musaea...a post for another time).

#### The Two Libraries of Antiquity...

Libraries have been the primary institutions of knowledge management throughout antiquity. Armed with writing, knowledge was no longer just the verbal passing down of knowledge and tales. In many similar institutions - I find the secular collection of knowledge to be fascinating, given that the topics of religious extremism or secularism remain just as pertinent today, as it would have been literally thousands of years ago, especially in the areas I am about to refer to. 

*Great* libraries could very well have been the ultimate amalgamation of humanity's knowledge at that point in history. A scholar's wet dream.

Two such libraries were the Great Library of Alexandria (~280BC) and the Library of Ashurbanipal (7th Century BC). Both probably reaching their apex during a golden age when there was an abundance of peace and free minds to think about existence rather than the next meal. 

#### ....and How they Burned

Things burning seem to common feature in history (From China to England, and every where in between), particularly on its ability to do long-lasting damage to institutions (old buildings, and the old things inside.)

I'll comment less on why they were destroyed (often overt war/invasion, or something more subtle like a general decline) and more on what struck me in each of the library's circumstances. 

The library of Alexandria, and its nearby store of 40,000 scrolls was accidentally burnt by Julius Caeser (thanks man..), something that would be a great, irretrievable lost for civilisation at its time. 

The library of Ashurbanipal on the other hand, with its  30,000 clay tablets, actually got toasted and baked (and despite being several centuries older, many of its texts are well preserved) - saving *The Epic of Gilgamesh* for us years later. 

#### and the point is...

What can we learn from this? Make clay and not paper? There could be some vague comment about the lightness and convenience of paper (but less resilient) vs the more labour-intensive and heavier chunks of clay inscriptions (but more resilient). 

I'm actually not sure what was the point I wanted to make. But the story of these two libraries is something I've romanticised

I guess its uh..worth thinking about what in our lives or society we should compartmentalise into:

"Clay Tablets" - that end up being stronger, more rigid, stagnant, yet permanent. 

or 

"Paper Scrolls" - faster, convenient, more flexible but one bad spark away from being irreversibly destroyed. 

Like libraries, instituions provide a shelter and house for things / content. And while these structures can last a long time, equally important is how the things inside are kept. 

#### Another Study in Resilience: The World's Oldest companies

Another observation that I glanced over at my time in an economic agency but has sort of stuck with me was the ability for the World's oldest companies to exist. How has some of these institutions, albeit on a smaller scale - survive wars, radical changes in political systems, people, and more?

Specifically, Japan (being the one of the world's largest economies), seems to have an unfair share of such companies: Kongo Gumi is /was one of these long lasting institutions, with a history of over 1,400 years. Although it was acquired not too long ago, one can consider that its presence (whether based on its physical buildings or its know-how) still carries on to this day. It was a construction company that specialied in temples. Japan is home to the most companies over 100 years old. Not a small feat at all.

Reading a couple of articles suggests:

- Family Ownership, and family succession (With a note on exceptions: eldest sons but also adopted sons are viable candidates)
- Values of Tradition, stability and sustainability over profit
- Understanding its role in the community
- Balancing: Prudence and diversification
- Sustainability over profit
- Risk-aversion 
	- Something easy to be critiqued when times are good - but there is evidence in longevity too. 
	- They were arguably inefficient too. But again, there is trade-off between stability and ruthless efficiency
