Rediscovering Belle Epoque, and the link and connection with a nice game i've picked up recently (Clair Obscur, expedition 33). 

A wistful being overcomes me. The philosopher. The Poet. Not the warrior, today. 

I listen to Tosti, which wikipedia says is representative of Salon Music. I read about the lineage of English kings. The rabbit hole brings be from Orleans (not far from where Caesar won the battle of Alesia), the hundred year's war; the black death, from Edward III to Elizabeth I. The franco-prussian war (preceding the belle epoque), and its note about the evolution of general staff.

It rains in a natural way. The way where the sky clears, and the birds come out once again. The sun is still out.

I revel in the peace of this time (it is 6.25pm), and the relative peacetime that I've been born into. I've been eating, on nice meaty food, walking trails across valleys used of invasion, and gazed from mountaintops, once used as strategic battlements. 

It is good to feel insignifcant and small.
