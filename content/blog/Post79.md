Inequality is [real and everywhere](https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post52/).  Inequality begets privilege. 

In my thinking, I define privilege with an emphasis on inheritance - for example a superior position  bestowed upon people brought up or born into positions of above average wealth, of no effort of their own. Merely through birthright and luck.  

I've felt its mostly a blessing and a little bit of a curse.  Don't get me wrong - it is objectively better to be privileged, but I'd add a consideration that being privileged could lead to greater expectations are more to lose. 

I was brought up with a degree of privilege - evident in my international upbringing. But it was only in the last few years that I had begun to frame a mental model around this. There are two main concepts with regards to Privilege based on my observations and experience. (Opinion, as usual)

### The Two Reactions to Privilege
It is interesting to find out how different people react in positions of inherited privilege. Perhaps more so, at an earlier stage in life when individuals may not realise their position of privilege; and similarly at a formative time when one is still developing their own identity and personality. 

Broadly, I classify these as i) looking upwards or ii) looking downwards,

Looking upwards is a basis of competition. To someone with this disposition, perhaps the goal is to continue building off such wealth as to outdo peers, fit-in, achieve an elevated social status in an environment abundant with superiority- a race to infinity. Exceptionality and excess are perhaps the name of the game here. 

Alternatively, there are those who look downwards -  finding salvation in the pity of others. An inherited Noblesse Oblige to solve the world's problems and to be generous or honourable. Whether warranted or unwarranted, there is an element of altruism, though the cynical side of me can also question its underlying motivations. Conformity and Duty are perhaps the values that standout here. 

Here, I apply a similar thinking to how the rich world seems more obsessed (maybe even slightly condescending) with the enablement of undeveloped regions with respect to the [Sustainability movement and narrative](https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post31/)).

I maintain that he expectations and emphasis on saving the world shouldn't be equally empathetic. There are however, plenty of good stuff out there I am sure. But my gut instinct on Pity Marketing I find can be far too superficial; and damaging. It is a fine line line for such superficial individuals or organisations to emotionally exploit their audience of less developed worlds for gain.


Though I identify with the latter, I cannot pass judgement on what is right or wrong. 

But it without a doubt shapes how people grow and how they approach life. More often than not, the greatest benefit in the privilege of wealth is the privilege of options. The privileged are afforded more freedoms and resources to achieve their best potential, in the absence of restrictions of access, discrimination, etc.

But Freedom is a fickle thing, and my second mental model observes (albeit imperfectly, and not universally) how people develop from inherited privilege:

### The Three Paths of Privilege
There are of course variances - an unfortunate truism in the world is that the privilege of wealth does not solve matters of the heart. There are broken wealthy families (perhaps complicated by wealth) as much as their are loving, materially less-off families.

1. Preservation - maintaining the status quo of a good job, possibly taking after what their role models had done - white collar finance, consulting, family businesses and the like. I see this as a continuation of what is recognisable and what is expected of success. There may not be major risks taken, in favour of risking the inherited position.
2. Mission - For the "looking downwards". They move into areas less focused on material but more attuned to matters of the heart. Journalism, storytelling with adventure, volunteering, the save-the-planet sorts. 
3. Hedonism -  With access to wealth, and perhaps the fear and inability to live up to expectations - one focuses on enjoyment and pleasure. More recently, the Tang Ping and Bai Lan movements in China remind me of this, much to the cultural dismay of an older Asian generation. 

In a battle for identity and purpose I have since placed myself somehwere between [Preservation and Mission](https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post62/), encapsualted in the work I do. Its only recently that I have figured out how to indulge a bit more in the moment...I often need a reminder to be less tough on myself. 
 
### An afterthought on Excess and Privilege

I commented that those "looking upwards"  puts people on a race to infinity - there will always be someone richer and better than yourself, especially so if wealth becomes a fundamental part of one's identity. 

And there are plenty of those with "Fuck you" Money - it can be ostentatious, gaudy, and emphasising the show and display (branded goods, etc). The 富二代 concept is similar (linked to 富不过三代  too) .

There is something about my [survival instincts](https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post15/), valuing self-sufficiency and desire to be a "self-made" person, that makes me despise such displays. There is a pressure there too that makes it difficult for me to truly break free from the imposter syndrome of having started in an advantageous position.

But humans are complex things - and behind every show is an actor following a script of expectations; a . Whether trying to make it in the big world from a lower point, or figuring out what life is from a higher vantage point. 

### A Picture of Privilege

If I could paint a picture - I see a hustler on the ground floor of a skyscraper. He sees each floor, each staircase as a hurdle to cross - but with it, is slow and steady progress - driven by the belief of achievement. 

I see also see a suited / hooded figure on the top of the skyscraper, overlooking a vast and infinite expanse of cityline, unable to make sense of it, and peers down into the busy road below, hundreds of meters down, with a deep sense of vertigo...
