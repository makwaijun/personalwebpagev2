TLDR;

- This post summarises my take/framework to understand political structures
- Disclaimer: I like the one I am under currently.
— 
A Singaporean and an American walk into the college bar. I remember bringing up the phrase a "Benevolent Dictatorship" - as the craft beer seeped into the recesses of my brain and dug up this phrase that I saw once, somewhere, sometime. (I don't think I was clever enough to come up with it on the spot, drunk enough perhaps). The next thing I remember the immense laughter and incredulity. But is it incredulous?

Every election season (well, of the US), or perhaps every time there is a China vs US fear - Political structures and ideology is always fun topic that will pop up everywhere. _Democracy vs authority! Left vs right! Socialism bad!_ Same shit, different year (aside from the top 10 reasons why _this_ one is different.

Indeed from my past work on the US-China tensions, the "spread" of Chinese-led totalitarianism seemed to be the forefront of the US view of China's motivations (and therefore their potentially misguided responses). I am mildy sceptical of this view still - the reasons to me are purely economical (But I haven't properly relooked this topic since 2019).

####  Spectrum of Ideological effectiveness

I summarise the big picture view of what I think is good and bad. 

1. Worst: Authoritarianism
2. Not bad:  Democracy 
3. Good: Benevolent Democracy
4. Great: Benevolent Authoritarianism 
5. (Bonus Best: Benevolent Absolutist)

Basically I want a nice god to run the world. Someone who makes no mistakes and the BEST Decision. I'd obey the hell out of this entity. 

I remain in the camp that a well-perfoming, benevolent dictatorship is the best political structure. I had [written before about the need for Trade-off decision making and governance](https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post50/) in today's complex world, which is only possible (especially so, in tough situations) with a steady, but strong hand in control. 

[Why Nations Fail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Nations_Fail)'s central thesis also presents a core thesis around Inclusive vs Extractive Institutions as a reason for the collapse of countries. Benevolence in this case, can be replaced by "Inclusivity". 

However, he posits that, based on his numerous historical examples, authoritarian states do not last in the long run, and fall eventually. Of course, he had not written out too well on the phenomena that is Singapore (and to some degree China) as an alternative model to the rather binary totalitarian vs democractic camp, but I suppose these are fringe cases from the more traditional theories on political system. Keep in mind, that some of the totalirian states that collapsed had in fact existed for hundreds of years. 

From a historical perspective, it is simply too soon to say whether democractic approaches are the best - its a first for humanity to have such a (relatively) equitable social structure for this many people around the world. I have written about the [engrained prevalance of inequality before](https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post52/). 

#### Keeping the Authoritarian Boat Afloat
But would authoritarianism similarly stand up to the test of time?

One core risk, is the government's "License to Operate". A benevolent dictatorship has been working insofar that things are going, well, actually pretty good. If we take China and the oft-compared Singapore as examples - generally, the economy has been doing well. Standards of living are high (and soaring in China's case, considering the advancement in the last decade), and the majority are happy. 

What would a Benevolent dictatorship look like when advanced coutnries become economically stagnant, demographics weaken and more? I think this is an area to be discovered or for a historical parallel to be found. Of course, this has to be taken against major radical shifts in the world which I think make any past historical comparisons impossible to find.

So I take any perspective who take a strong stance on what's better vs what's worse with a pinch of salt. Democracy has not been proven in the next cycle (centuries) of humanity, and neither have benevolent dictatorships. Time will tell…

More likely than not, we are again at the mercy of [Kyklos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyklos), which holds just as true as it did in antiquity as it does now. The true luck and blessing is to be born and dead at a certain part of a [cycle](https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post41/). 

I suppose if my parent's generation (Baby boomers) could be viewed as a golden age of humanity, it is not bad to be born at the (seemingly) tail end of this mega cycle. 

####  Educating myself: Socialism
Keeps coming up and can be fashionable to hate/love. What is it? I had no (proper) clue, so I listend to this [podcast episode](https://economicupdate.libsyn.com/socialism-and-worker-co-ops).
In non-political science background, I understand it to be a structure built by/run by society. But within this, there are several types which I picked up while frying something for dinner. 

- Scandivian (governmental socialism - safety nets) 
- Communist (governmental socialism - control)
Dr. Wolff advocates or contemplates the need for something in between. 

To me (and as with everything to me, its a balance), Market-based socialism or something that deliver value to society is of paramount importance (and hence the [abhorrence at rent-seeking/non-value creating industries](https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post44/) ), but being increasingly challenged these days. 

Unfortuntely, the capitalist engine is running against the political grain on this one.
