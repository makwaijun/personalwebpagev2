The series of posts on sustainability surfaced several open questions, which will be explored in the upcoming posts - albeit not directly.

1) The [fracturing of cohesiveness](https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post28/) along lines of division (all kinds of lines, age, economic status, etc, etc)

2)  The [rise of the intangible economy](https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post29/), as value shifts towards the digital domain and [marketing over quality](https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post31/).

3) The compatibility of Political models to solve planetary issues.

4) The narrative of Sustainable growth vs De-growth. (i.e. the problems with De-growth, and possible solutions)

This will link to the core content described in an earlier post on having a [Conciliatory view on the Economy of the Future](https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post13/).

On a more operational note, I am struggling to find a good way to include charts and diagrams onto the Hugo infrastructure. There are definitely ways, but I need to spend far more time on learning the technical aspects. In the meantime, words will have to suffice.

I shall aim to complete this series this month.
