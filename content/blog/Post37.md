2. Increasing complexity
3. Correlatory to Human needs and wants.

commoditisation and consolidation.



This was spotted through  I suggest one hypothesis, which hinges on the core concept of differentiation.



**Complements the preceding Chapter in an additive fashion **, by doing currently known things better, cheaper, faster.
