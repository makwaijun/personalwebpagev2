We appear, for many reasons, to be at an inflection point of change. This post will attempt to explain my view of why we can expect more changes, why there are so many struggles with this change, and where we might be headed towards - further explored in the subsequent most.

### Why we Expect Changes - Kondratieff 101

Credit where credit is due - this was introduced to me by an incredible manager I worked with. 

Today we are faced with great uncertainty. As characterized by a privately published article by Ian Bremmer's Gzero Media (likely inspired from a few sources)

I think they summed up our current position as an inflection point rather neatly:

- Economically, as we enter a whole new world of low interest rates, and modern monetary theory
- Politically, as the east "threatens*" the west, and the tensions arising from conservative and liberal political ideologies.
- Environmentally, as we enter a new era of more volatile era, biodiversity loss, so on and so forth.

Yet, it is important to realize that none of these are new. Kondratieff (Soviet era economist) as well as several other academics, have presented ideas the concept of economic waves and cycles that have held true over the past centuries(more modern economies). Each occur at different rates. 

- Kitchin cycle (inventory, e.g. pork cycle) - short cycle
- Juglar cycle (fixed investment) - medium 
- Kuznets swing (infrastructural investment) - long
- Kondratiev wave (technological basis) - very long

Indeed some of my thinking of the prior economic chapters stems from inspiration from these greats. These point towards how the world has ebbed and flowed between different upturns and downturns. What we struggle wit

As concerning as many of the issues in the world may be - thus prompting strong reaction and commentary.

When contextualised against the thousands of years of history

The world quite simply must be trending to a better place. Current expectation/ desire deals with exorbitant profit as a goal.



### The importance of Thinking in Cycles

I reflect the importance of thinking in cycles as a way of understanding the world. 

The theory of cycles hold true in the past, the present and future. A long lasting principle if you will. But waves are humbling. 
It tells us that no one ever got it right. It reminds us that our pursuit of the perfect answer is inherently flawed. Whenever and what ever the case may be, is always important to remain flexible and adaptable, no matter how "stable" things may be. 

We regress (or progress?) by switching sides in many domains. Economic or political as shared.

As much as humans have fought nature, macro forces and the nature of each cycle seems to correct humanity before we can correct ourselves. I wonder how much control that we collectively as a civilisation have over these. Governments and INternational instiutions may temper the volatility of these (e.g. Despite our current cycle, it doesn't *seem* like we are headed to World War III), but each transition creates a difficult and uncertain time for those living in it.


Will we ever overcome this to form a permanent end state? Or will we huannirt forever struggle against the whims of the invisible wave.

### Why We Still Struggle -The Curse of Measurement

What is the ultimate measure of intangibility?

Ironically, I think one of them is its ability to be measured.

As mentioned, I

Yet, I would argue that even recent trends around say - Sustainability, or even Artificial Intelligence. "Innovation" while desirable by governments and companies alike, often have no idea.

I take anyone who professes to be an exp

Without measurement, the conventiona



As i wrote at the end of my series of sustainaiblity posts, a new economic model is demanded by the planet. If not capitalism - what else?

### Why We Struggle - The Productivity Paradox -

- The thirst for productivity has increased inter-nation comeptitiveness, but ultimately is a key destroyer of jobs. 

Another big concern amongst economists (especially in Singapore) is this everlasting concern and struggle.

It is no myth that Productivity has stagnated in many modern economies. Intuitively, this makes no sense 

Insidiously, 

But each revolutionary spark does not necessarily correlate to improvements. The lead time between invention to critical mass often takes a far longer time. While people are spending the bulk of their money of

Yet, leading economies, as I remarked in my previous posts are 

But at what level are technological disruptions necessary?

Essentially, are we collectively creating, marketing, buying and attributing value to things with increasing diminishing returns?

 then complaining why theres so little value gained from it at a macro level.



I note that Chapter 6 - Modern services and the advent of marketing as being revolutionary from a business point of view, as it shifts away from matching supply and demand to *creating* demand. This has been a great source of innovation and disruption, but as I shared in a previous post - has the potential to be misguided. 

The Productivity Paradox
The thirst for productivity has increased inter-nation comeptitiveness, but ultiamtely is a key destroyer of jobs.
