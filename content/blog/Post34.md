TLDR;
- Economic development and technological advancement across mankind's history can be broken down into "chapters".
- Capital flows into phenomenon characteristic of each chapter. This is where jobs are created, innovation is nurtured and companies are most profitable. 
- Each chapter is marked by cycles of emergence, differentiation, profitability, commoditisation and consolidation.
- The emergence of a new chapter is increasing at a faster rate.

### Preamble

As described in my earlier post on thinking critically with the [assistance of history](https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post27/), this post sets out an anecdotal / semi-novel supposition on how economies have grown and developed over time. Thinking around [separating economic growth into different phases is not new](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostow%27s_stages_of_growth), but this is my different take on it.

Much like the approach to sustainability, this posts kick-starts a second series of posts on all things economic. Much like the former topic, the "economy" (in however you may wish to define it) is messy, complex, and a contemporary source much angst and fear. As such, I felt it would be worthwhile to embark on developing a unifying framework to understand and connect the dots between my casual observations and thoughts on the issue.

This observation is underpinned by a key assumption about how the principles of business have been consistent over time: Capitalism (in its various forms across history) will always encourage **higher growth** (New markets or new products, etc). As long as businesses are financed by a third party - higher growth and returns will always be demanded. As a result, businesses will **always find a way to pivot and differentiate** - to the extent of finding or making their own "excuse" - in order to stay competitive.

### The Chapters Of Economic Development

To date, I roughly *think* that there have been seven-odd chapters of economic development and progress. Viewing economic development through eras are not new, but I hope that the characteristics and observations on each are hopefully novel.

Each chapter represents the principle driver of economic ("phenomenon") activity throughout periods of time. I placed a mental flagpost where the chapter's phenomenon became significantly widespread <u>across the world</u>. This is because many economies and societies developed at different rates, and the aim of this framework is to take the perspective of human civilisation in its entirety, rather than that of select communities. These flagposts are not intended to be scientific, but hopefully enough to form a picture the era in your mind.

The corresponding phenomenon of each chapter is characterised by the following features: 

1. **A ground-breaking technological advancement**. Each chapter is revolutionary in nature, sparked by some form of revolution - often technological in nature, in my observation.
2. **Complements the preceding Chapter in an additive fashion **, by doing currently known things better, cheaper, faster.
3. **High economic profitability**, as companies are able to differentiate themselves and out-compete due to the above.
4. **High investment**. This is because (as per the capitalist economic system) returns of investment and growth are at its highest, for the reason above.
5. **High job creation potential.** As investment flows to these emergent sectors. 
6. **Socio-economic premium**, as individuals working in these sectors do comparatively well.
7. **Emergence of specialised hubs**, as agglomerations of assets and people working in these sectors outperform other locations.

<reminder to self: The final two breeds domestic inequality and international inequality,for the  future post>

I will try an encapsulate some of these through a representative persona (e.g. the archetype of success at that time, with the exception of the ruling class). 

#### Chapter 1: Consumption

*Achieved Critical mass: Antiquity*

Since the beginning of mankind - consumption of food and services were the primary socio-economic activity. Think foraging; Chimps picking parasites off one-another; drinking river water; so on and so forth. In this chapter, there was not much specialisation - aside from implicit social-hierachies, individuals and communities sought out efficient ways to consume, roaming across the land over the seasons.

> > **What differentiated individuals, communities and societies was their physical strength and endurance.**

<u>"Strong arm" Sam</u> would probably have done well living in this era, as an emphasis would have been placed on physical attributes, primal survival instincts and a band of merry warriors. 

#### Chapter 2: Resource Development

*Achieved Critical mass: to be researched further*

Several thousand (or maybe more) years ago, nomadic humans decided to settle down and invest in fixed assets beyond living off the wild. In this chapter, economic activity related to farming, construction, livestock management, material extraction (e.g. mining, wood cutting) and much more became new, important economic roles at that time. 

> **What differentiated individuals, communities and societies was their ability to exploit their environment to their benefit.**

<u>"Green Thumbs" George</u>, living in a place rich in natural resources, fertile soil, etc would probably have done pretty well living in this chapter. Hopefully he wasn't taxed too many bushels of grain. He would probably have been the client of <u>"Strong arm" Sam</u> to help him defend his farm. 

#### Chapter 3: Craftsmanship

*Achieved Critical Mass: to be researched further* - bronze age?

Artisans of the bronze age converted raw products and goods into useful tools. Pottery, metallurgy and woodworking are examples of this (I attribute my hundreds of hours spent playing age of empires/ civilization V for this history lesson). A society in this chapter could have had its respected artisans, sculptors, carpenters, etc who transformed raw resources into far higher value products. 

> **What differentiated  individuals, companies and societies was their ability to increase the value of raw goods.**

<u>Carpenter "Magic Hands" Michael</u> would probably have worked as an apprentice first, before making a name for himself as a renowned craftsman for the highest echelons of society (Kings, Priests, etc). Jack would probably have bought premium products (say - rare flowers for dye-making) from <u>"Green thumbs" George</u> to produce his high-quality crafts.

#### Chapter 4: Trade and Globalisation

*Achieved Critical Mass: The Age of Exploration (1400s to 1600s)*

As humans became able to travel widely, there was added value in finding goods and services from other locations where it is cheaper to make, and to be sold on where there is greater value. This very same principle represents much of how global trade is (in theory) organised today.

In a space of a few centuries, economic activity was no longer premised on efficiency of society's capacity, but rather based on its location, access and connectivity to other productive civilisations and communities as well. These produced cities who could thrive as trading hubs. The merchant class emerged as another social strata that was been well represented in some ancient social structures, pointing to their importance. 

> **What differentiated individuals, companies and societies at this stage was their capacity to profit off global trade flows.** 

<u>Merchant "Midas Man" Marcus</u> would have thrived on cross-border trade, and made a tidy profit off the trade routes plied between the new world and the old. He would have bought goods from <u>"Magic Hands" Michael</u> from a port in a far off land and sold them at triple the value in another.

Key technologies includes international travel (ships, caravans), as well as development of the modern financing and trade systems (beyond informal bartering).

#### Chapter 5: Mass Production (Industries 1.0 & 2.0)

*Achieved Critical Mass: First Industrial Revolution (1800s)*

Enabled by the availability of cheaper raw goods (often from out-of-town), mass production gave huge returns to capital as production became more of a science than an art. Systems and processes were heavily optimised to maximise productivity, profitability, while at the same time minimising costs.

> **What differentiated individuals, companies and societies at this stage was their ability to maximise profits from efficient production using economies of scale.** 

<u>Factory-Owner Ford</u> would have excelled during this period as the boss of a capital-intensive but highly profitable factory. He would relied on <u>"Midas Man" Marcus</u> for the import of cheap goods and export of premium goods.

Key technological developments of this phase include mass production and mechanisation.

#### Chapter 6: Modern Services - The transition towards a knowledge based economy

*Achieved Critical Mass: Post-World War Golden age (1970s)*

As the manufacturing productivity continued to hum in the background, a new era of "corporatisation" emerged. Advertising, accounting as well as the professionalisation of corporate functions (HR, Finance, etc) became a core focus of economic activity. This correlates with a new class of jobs - the traditional White Collar types - who took on non-manual work in offices. 

> **What set apart individuals, companies and societies at this stage was their ability to create new markets and optimise organisational efficiency.**  

<u>"Mad Men" Matthew</u> would probably have been well respected during this era. He markets and advertises the mass produced goods made by <u>Factory-Owner Ford</u>.

Key technological developments of this phase includes...nothing actually - this was a man-made phenomena. I will touch on this aspect more in subsequent posts.

#### Chapter  7: Digital (Industrie 3.0 & 4.0)

*First observed: (Dot com Boom) ~2000s*

This brings us to now - where digital and more broadly "tech" is the core driver of the modern economy. It is unthinkable for many modern businesses to not have a digital aspect to it (be it hardware or software). This stage could be split into some subchapters around Computing (Industrie 3.0) and the current stage we are in where AI, and Big Data (Industrie 4.0) are all the jazz. 

But more broadly:

> **What differentiated individuals, companies and societies at this stage was their ability adopt and apply new technologies**.

<u>"Silicon Valley" Shelly</u> would do well in this world. She does UI/UX for a Software-as-a-Service company, helping people like <u>"Mad Men" Matthew</u> optimize their Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems.

Key technological advancements includes Silicon-on-chip and the subsequent computing revolution.

###   On the Consequence of Being Born in the Wrong Era

Before jumping on - I wanted to include a (rather emotive) demonstration of this framework. I think of the phrase: "I was born in the wrong era" as being the illustrative question on this. 

For example:

- A strong, possibly psychotic combatant today would probably land himself in prison, while he would have been hailed as a respected warrior in Chapter 1 (Consumption). 

- An artistically inclined individual - good with their hands may find themselves fitting the stereotypical "starving artist" in today's world, but could have very well thrived during Chapter 3 (Craftsmanship).

- Conversely, an uncharismatic, albeit brainy computer-savvy geek would have been trodden on in previous eras, but now has the opportunity to thrive in our current digital world.

As a result of this thinking - I believe the answer to the question is a resounding Yes. There are real implications as to how well your innate skills fit what is being valued by the particular economic chapter you live in. Tough.

What was originally intended to be one post has now since been partitioned out into three. The next two posts will expand on this framework by layering on more pattern-spotting and observations that seek to answer:

- What causes a new chapter to be written?
- What is its impact on businesses?
- Where are we headed to in the near-term? I.e. What is the next chapter?
- How have these structures fundamentally changed? I.e. Does this model still hold? (short answer...I don't quite think so...)
