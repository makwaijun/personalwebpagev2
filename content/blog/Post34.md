TLDR;
- Economic development and technological advancement across mankind's history can be framed by "chapters".
- Chronology aside, these Chapters highlight what it took to be differentiated during that era. 
- This was/ is the ultimate driver of job creation, profits, and innovation - core aspects of any economy.

### Preamble  -still a work in progress on how best to frame craftmanship and/or manufacturing

As described in my earlier post on thinking critically with the [assistance of history](https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post27/), this post sets out an anecdotal / semi-novel supposition on how economies have grown and developed over time. The idea of [separating economic growth into different phases is not new](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostow%27s_stages_of_growth), but this is my own personal and internalised take on it.

Much like the approach to sustainability, this posts kick-starts a second series of posts on all things economic. The "economy" (in however you may wish to define it) is messy, complex, and a source much angst and fear. As such, I felt it would be worthwhile to embark on building a unifying framework to understand and connect the dots between my casual observations and thinking on the topic.

### The Story Of Economic Development

Although "Economic Development" is often used in the context of countries, this framework takes the bigger-picture approach to understand how economies have evolved across time and countries. The aim of this framework is to take the perspective of human civilisation in its <u>entirety</u>, rather than that of select communities. 

To date, I postulate that there have been seven-odd chapters of economic development and progress. Viewing [economic development through eras are not new](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostow%27s_stages_of_growth), but I hope that the characteristics and observations on each are hopefully novel, in this post and others.

Each Chapter represents the principle driver of economic activity (**"Title"**) throughout periods of time. The corresponding Titles of each chapter often have the following features: 

1. **Heralded by a Disruptive Development**, by doing currently known things better, cheaper, faster. These could be due to a wide range of reasons, technology-included, which I describe in my next post.
2. **High economic profitability**, as companies are able to differentiate themselves and out-compete due to the above.
3. **High investment**, as returns of investment and growth are at its highest, for the reason above.  (This assumes the modern financing system)
4. **High job creation potential**, as investment flows to these emergent sectors.  
5. **Socio-economic premium**, as individuals working in these sectors do comparatively well.
6. **Emergence of specialised hubs**, as agglomerations of assets and people working in these sectors outperform other locations.

Points 2 to 6 captures the key concept of this framework - that is, **Differentiation**.

<reminder to self: Points 5 and 6 breeds domestic inequality and international inequality, for the  future post>

To best illustrate some of these, (in my very roundabout attempt-to-be-a-humanities-student kind of way), I attempt to use:

- Representative personas of success (e.g. the archetype of success at that time, with the exception of the ruling class)
- Rough timestamps to help anchor each chapter in a time period of human history. These mental flagposts are not intended to be scientific, an assumes a period where the chapter's "Title" became significantly widespread <u>across the world</u>. I concede that there are some natural discrepancies here, as economies developed at different rates. 
- Key technological advancmenets of that era.

#### Chapter 1: Consumption

*Achieved Critical mass: Antiquity*

Since the beginning of mankind - consumption of food and services were the primary socio-economic activity. Think foraging; Chimps picking parasites off one-another; drinking river water; so on and so forth. In this chapter, there was not much specialisation - aside from implicit social-hierachies, individuals and communities sought out efficient ways to consume, roaming across the land over the seasons.

> **What differentiated individuals, communities and societies was their physical strength and endurance.**

<u>"Strong arm" Sam</u> would probably have done well living in this era, as an emphasis would have been placed on physical attributes, primal survival instincts and a band of merry warriors. 

#### Chapter 2: Resource Development

*Achieved Critical mass: to be researched further*

Several thousand (or maybe more) years ago, nomadic humans decided to settle down and invest in fixed assets beyond living off the wild. In this chapter, economic activity related to farming, construction, livestock management, material extraction (e.g. mining, wood cutting) and much more became new, important economic roles at that time. 

> **What differentiated individuals, communities and societies was their ability to exploit their environment to their benefit.**

<u>"Green Thumbs" George</u>, living in a place rich in natural resources, fertile soil, etc would probably have done pretty well living in this chapter. Hopefully he wasn't taxed too many bushels of grain. He would probably have been the client of <u>"Strong arm" Sam</u> to help him defend his farm. 

#### Chapter 3: Craftsmanship

*Achieved Critical Mass: to be researched further* - bronze age?

Artisans of the bronze age converted raw products and goods into useful tools. Pottery, metallurgy and woodworking are examples of this (I attribute my hundreds of hours spent playing age of empires/ civilization V for this history lesson). A society in this chapter could have had its respected artisans, sculptors, carpenters, etc who transformed raw resources into far higher value products. 

> **What differentiated  individuals, companies and societies was their ability to increase the value of raw goods.**

<u>Carpenter "Magic Hands" Michael</u> would probably have worked as an apprentice first, before making a name for himself as a renowned craftsman for the highest echelons of society (Kings, Priests, etc). Jack would probably have bought premium products (say - rare flowers for dye-making) from <u>"Green thumbs" George</u> to produce his high-quality crafts.

#### Chapter 4:  Global Trade

*Achieved Critical Mass: The Age of Exploration (1400s to 1600s)*

As humans became able to travel widely, there was added value in finding goods and services from other locations where it is cheaper to make, and to be sold on where there is greater value. This very same principle represents much of how global trade is (in theory) organised today.

In a space of a few centuries, economic activity was no longer premised on efficiency of society's capacity, but rather based on its location, access and connectivity to other productive civilisations and communities as well. These produced cities who could thrive as trading hubs. The merchant class emerged as another social strata that was been well represented in some ancient social structures, pointing to their importance. 

> **What differentiated individuals, companies and societies at this stage was their capacity to profit off global trade flows.** 

<u>Merchant "Midas Man" Marcus</u> would have thrived on cross-border trade, and made a tidy profit off the trade routes plied between the new world and the old. He would have bought goods from <u>"Magic Hands" Michael</u> from a port in a far off land and sold them at triple the value in another.

Key technologies includes international travel (ships, caravans), as well as development of the modern financing and trade systems (beyond informal bartering).

#### Chapter 5: Mass Production (Industries 1.0 & 2.0)

*Achieved Critical Mass: First Industrial Revolution (1800s)*

Enabled by the availability of cheaper raw goods (often from out-of-town), mass production gave huge returns to capital as production became more of a science than an art. Systems and processes were heavily optimised to maximise productivity, profitability, while at the same time minimising costs.

> **What differentiated individuals, companies and societies at this stage was their ability to maximise profits from efficient production using economies of scale.** 

<u>Factory-Owner Ford</u> would have excelled during this period as the boss of a capital-intensive but highly profitable factory. He would relied on <u>"Midas Man" Marcus</u> for the import of cheap goods and export of premium goods.

Key technological developments of this phase include mass production and mechanisation.

#### Chapter 6: Modern Services - The transition towards a knowledge based economy

*Achieved Critical Mass: Post-World War Golden age (1970s)*

As the manufacturing productivity continued to hum in the background, a new era of "corporatisation" emerged. Advertising, accounting as well as the professionalisation of corporate functions (HR, Finance, etc) became a core focus of economic activity. This correlates with a new class of jobs - the traditional White Collar types - who took on non-manual work in offices. 

> **What differentiated individuals, companies and societies at this stage was their ability to optimise organisational efficiency.**  

<u>"Mad Men" Matthew</u> would probably have been well respected during this era. He markets and advertises the mass produced goods made by <u>Factory-Owner Ford</u>.

Key technological developments of this phase includes...nothing actually - this was a man-made phenomena. I will touch on this aspect more in subsequent posts.

#### Chapter  7: Digital (Industrie 3.0 & 4.0)

*First observed: (Dot com Boom) ~2000s to now

This brings us to now - where digital and more broadly "tech" is the core driver of the modern economy. It is unthinkable for many modern businesses to not have a digital aspect to it (be it hardware or software). This stage could be split into some subchapters around Computing (Industrie 3.0, probably around 1990s) and the current stage we are in where AI, and Big Data (Industrie 4.0) are all the jazz. 

But more broadly:

> **What differentiated individuals, companies and societies at this stage was their ability adopt and apply new technologies**.

<u>"Silicon Valley" Shelly</u> would do well in this world. She does UI/UX for a Software-as-a-Service company, helping people like <u>"Mad Men" Matthew</u> optimize their Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems.

### So... What's Next?

I hypothesize that the business cycles (who are the ultimate creators, deployers and appliers of new technology) point towards the early signs of where we are in terms of the next chapter. I feel that there are currently three in the making, all at different stages of being written. 

1. Sustainability - Wide ranging consequences and applicability economy-wide.
2. Platforms Re-discovered*
3. Quantum

What was originally intended to be one post has now since been partitioned out into four. There are simply too many ideas to compres neatly into one page! The next couple of posts will expand on this framework by layering on more pattern-spotting and observations that seek to answer:

- What causes a new chapter to be written?
- How do these work in the context of businesses and individuals?
- Where are we headed to in the near-term? I.e. What is the next chapter?
- How have these structures fundamentally changed? I.e. Does this model still hold? (short answer...I don't quite think so...)

**Afternote on platforms:*

*If defined as a model that creates value by facilitating exchange, then infrastructure and utility owners are technically platforms in and of themselves. If say - a railway structure - did not exist, a huge swathe of users and consumers would not be connected to one another. These include train operators, freight operators as well as the ancillary services found at each trains station.*

*These often form a monopoly or monopsony in behaviour.* 

*What may have changed is the accessibility to enter such platforms (Cost to entry) in the non-physical realm. The Digital Chapter has re-enabled this pre-existing model in a different way.*
