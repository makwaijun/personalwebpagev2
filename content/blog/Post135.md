Noting and recording what someone (corporate, non philosophical stuff really), said about energy at a talk I attended in Mid April 2025

### Principles in the Future of Energy
The elegance and simplicity in taking a long-term principled view based on several fundamentals:

1. Energy consumption will rise, significantly.
2. Developing countries will demand more energy, as they develop
3. Every industrial revoluton (currently AI), often drives a step-change in energy consumption.

New trends to look out for:
1. Non-conventional Fusion
2. Quantm Computing 

The natural conclusion:
- Greater efficiency in existing areas
- Managing energy deployment to the right place and the right time
- More, sustainable energy will continue to be needed

A useful fundamental base to cut through the noise.
