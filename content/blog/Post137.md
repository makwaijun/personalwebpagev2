I was introduced to Agency as an idea. This was well explained in the [article](http://highagency.com). A fun read, accompanied by memes and graphic accompaniments.

Its a concept that acts well as an intermediary between the idealist notion of absolute freedom, and the practicalities of life. 

For we can't control everything, nor can we find perfection in maximising anything. But preserving a degree of element of choice and control within the world's constraints is something that i find is:
1. Earned and maintained through responsibility
2. Sets up a virtuous cycle

I was reminded of this recently, at a period of time when i juggle perhaps one too many things... (Part time studies, captain in Army, Trade association Exco member, and now a ever accelerated level of responsibility at work).

And there were "those days": I reca during a mobilisation manning day, also being an intense day of dealing with some work matters and submitting a coursework, before running off to camp before an advance party deadline.

It is more pronounced when i face multiple fact

Both of which allow me to perform for myself, and balance all my obligations.
Agency is an interim goal preceding ultimate freedom.

Being able to travel more freely, when some rules don't allow it,
Being able to care for myself with less permission (seeing a dr and staying out)
Being able to be less harassed by work (with the understanding that things are under control even when i am away)Â 

However, the most impactful and Free-ing one i observed, as a leader, is being able to do this, while those i'm expected to lead encourage me to take a break, and to really have a peace of mind to be guilt-free. A nice revelation, from this year.

I believe that higher agency correlates strongly with essentially "not needing to be told what to do". That there is trust, respect and competency built in to make and manage the right thing at the right time.

In some cases, i prioritised my personal health, on my own volition, with the full understanding that i'd push myself hard in return. It is a mature decision: than blatantly pushing myself too far to failure.

### When life feels sorted
I also had a recent discussion (one of those after too many a long day/ week), when one is asked: "when does your life feel its sorted".

I premise it on some degree of freedom and sense of security from inevitable aspects of life. Some are more obvious than others.

Freedom from hunger, poverty, and shelter, are important and cover the basics.

But equally so is a freedom from parental expectations, societal exepctations, community / religious expectations. 

Before transcending into freedom from the self, from one's own ambition for instance, or the appeasement of mind for worrying about those you care and love for. 

When many of these are met, or settled, I would say that life would be more "sorted". Although, as was wisely pointed out - sorted-ness is not necessarily the end goal or destination. But also enjoying and celebrating the journey of a living life.
