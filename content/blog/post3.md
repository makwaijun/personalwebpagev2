## Keeping Momentum
Its been a while.

It had been on the back of my mind for a while to perhaps maintain a steady cadence to blogging. Recent news triggered a short reaction. Specifically on....

## On Hong Kong

Hong Kong renders as odd feeling in me. 

I am, and fully identify as being Singaporean (perhaps an idea worth exploring in future posts) in citizenship, but I am half-Hong Konger in blood. 
I have only been there twice in my life. And my cantonese is terrible. 

I cannot help but feel that the golden age of Hong Kong is over. And I must feel sorry for my peers and friends there. Expectations will need to be changed. 

## The Stage is Already Set

The US China trade war has been going on for a while. 

I view the recent escalation in tensions between the two largely coinciding with the timeline of american politics. Both Trump and Biden are competing to demonstrate who is the most "anti-China". 

As is common these days, the measures imposed appear rash and extreme and are not necessarily rational or logical. It is but another manifestation of good ol' politics in the lead up to the US elections.

Perhaps as a side effect of this - the US no longer recognises [HK's autonomy](https://thediplomat.com/2020/05/the-us-no-longer-considers-hong-kong-autonomous-what-does-that-mean/) . I am afraid that the US may have played directly into China's hands. 

It is certainly not in China's interest to keep Hong Kong afloat. China is not as dependent on Hong Kong's special concessions as others might think. 
The nearby Shenzhen is already a thriving business hub in nearby Guangdong. If anything, a collapsed Hong Kong removes a thorn in China's side. A weakened Hong Kong means no more protests. It means a Hong Kong, once powerful and rich, will become decrepit and frail; eventually relying on the mouth it once fed to feed itself.

There will be no good reason to do business in Hong Kong. Capital will drain out. The best and brightest will leave.
Foreigners will be first to go. 

Rich Hong Kongers might have the capacity to escape. Already, UK and Taiwan are wooing their citizens. These individuals may not hold any allegiance to the state. Certainly not to China.

Who might remain? 

The begrudged but optionless? The ones who have shifted their allegiances to China and its handout-diplomacy?

These are hypothetical. I may be out of touch with what is happening on the ground. 

##HK 2050

I wonder what the Hong Kong of 2050 will look like. 

A hollowed out gray city with an aging population. Skyscrapers that once held the gems of Asian finance emptied out.
Smatterings of Chinese rule persist. Indeed Hong Kong needs China more than ever before.


This is perhaps just an opinion. A view from the perspective of 2020. Will hopefully reopen this timecapsule later.
