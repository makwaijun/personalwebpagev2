goodm, honest, hard work
Success 
Reflections on what I like to do - what makes me tick:
Strategy big picture suttf, 
Running organised, meetings and hitting meeting outcomes 
Being trusted, the closed door 1-1 meetings.
Interviewing and hiring for character; Mentoring and getting the best out of people (interns) 
Things i dont like to do:
Legal
Accounting 
Making slides (I'm aesthetically challenged) 
Curious (haven't done) 
Possible regrets: Overseas, structured experience,
Working on a production line so as to truly understand the on the ground experience
