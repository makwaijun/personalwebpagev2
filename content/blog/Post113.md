Based on my mindset in 2023, I note down some quick reflections and reviews on what I've reflected on a slightly less than straightforward career so far.

A useful exercise to maintain perspective, especially given i) my high tendency for emotionally investing in work; and ii) consistent lack of clear targets and structure since the beginning of my career. 

### Conditions to thrive:
* Domain or thematic interest
* oustanding leaders
* Great team
* Hard work is fine, as long as its Good, honest
* Success and achievement

### Reflections on what I like to do - what makes me tick:
* Strategy big picture stuff
* Running organised, meetings and hitting meeting outcomes 
* Being trusted, the closed door 1-1 meetings.
* Interviewing and hiring for character; 
* Mentoring and getting the best out of people (interns) for now

### Things i dont like to do:
* Legal
* Accounting 
* Making slides (I'm aesthetically challenged) 

### Curious (haven't done) 
* Possible regrets: Overseas, structured experience,
* Working on a production line so as to truly understand the on the ground experience
* Product development

### Key areas to fully complete my skillset in 10 years
* R&D and technology
* Production / operations
* Procurement 

The ultimate goal is to complete some level of exposure opportunities to optimise and thrive.

In summary though, I reflect on quite the experience:

In terms of environments, I've had experinece across MNCs, Government, Start up and Scale ups.

In terms of functional skill sets, I started with a high level strategic view, to Finance, investor relations and HR. These days, I am involved in Business Development, Sales and Marketing, government relations. 


But, as with many things, what I've relinquished in depth, I've built a strong empathetic view in how many various business functions. A bad process is often built an issue with capability, resources, and common business understanding....and everything in between.
