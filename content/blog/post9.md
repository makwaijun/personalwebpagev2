#### TLDR;

- Geographically, Singapore lends itself to trade. Singapore has a rich heritage of merchants and traders.
- The Merchant mindset prefers to take, and not make. 
- This puts Singapore at an inherent disadvantage to *create* value. 
- As the economy grows more intangible (article for another time), this also skews us towards a profit-without-product state. This is not resilient or healthy in the long-term.
- But things are temporal - cultures take time to change.

#### History of Singapore's Role in International Systems

Since the late Medieval Era, merchants ranging from China, Europe and the Middle East appear to have engaged with the settlement based on historical records. Archaeological evidence points towards Singapore (or Temasek as it was known then), as a trading centre with a fortified city. It is conceivable that this role as a trading hub persisted across many historical eras through the Majapahits, the Srivijaya and the dominant coastal powers at that time. It makes sense that the island along the straits of Malacca made it well inclined to be a trading hub.

Yet, its geographic strengths alone was not enough to save it. There are no good records from the decline of the Sultanate of Malacca until the arrival of the British in the 19th Century. It is unclear if this was a dark age or time for the island now known as Singapore.

### The prevailing Merchant Mindset in Singapore

Without getting into the details too deeply into identity, questioning what a nation is, etc. I find it very much believable - at a broad level - that the economy, culture and norms of a nation are heavily influenced by its location and geography. Singapore's geography has naturally led it to develop its reputed openness for business and trade; diversity and multiculturalism; neutrality and peace-loving disposition. 

However, I wonder if this has also shaped Singaporean society in a certain way. 

In an economy that thrives on trade, it makes sense that society may also have evolved with the "merchant-mindset". Its a bit of a loose term. But I define it as one that doesn't create products. Instead, much of what the society does is to profit off others, and skimming money off the flows between others. For example, roles related to retail, distribution and commodity trade. The "nobility" of Singapore in the 19th century were examples of this. Many leading figures were renowned and well-connected merchants, which created much of the old-money elites. It is important too to recognise their contributions and returns to society. Tan Tock Seng is a good example of this - he has a hospital named after him.

#### Taking will always be more attractive than making

In more modern times, Singapore has since built itself as a logistics and financial hub. Again, providing essential services for global trade and finance, and being rewarded handsomely from such flows. 

As much as we try, our push for STEM subjects has not really redirected Singaporeans away from this culture. The finance and services industry remains fairly glamourous and the paramour of many young graduates. Many top engineering graduates do not do engineering. Though skilled to do so, few engineers *make*. Instead, they join the cadre of business graduates who continue to *take* and profit from the flows of others.

Digital and technology companies have since become the next sexy thing for many STEM graduates. Yet again, much of the product creation and hard technical skills to build products reside overseas. And so, the digital revolution has instead continued on with the prevailing trend of *taking* and not *making*. 

I caveat that this is not meant to be a criticism, merely an observation.

#### It is not healthy in the long run

In the future, my concerns lie in whether this has tilted Singapore's economy and society in an unhealthy manner.

Digital marketing, digital advertising, fintech, drop-shipping and Cryptocurrency (*retches*) are new sectors that many Singaporeans have gravitated to. 

With the absence of a tangible product, it is far too easy for many of these businesses to be dealing in the economics of bullshit. To illustrate: The "product" is funded by hyped-up venture capitalists, advertised by snake-oil sales people, and surreptitiously sold to anxious customers who frankly should invest or spend their money on more meaningful things. This is bad for the broader society. An economy driven by novelty has its limits.

More broadly, these activities are neither economically nor societally enriching. Again, these are geared towards *taking* without *creating* anything actually valuable. Aside from this being a purely **extractive** activity without really adding anything substantive in terms of creation, I shall also talk about the evils of marketing and advertising in another post at some point (reminder: link mkt/ adv post here).

When everyone "sells" and no one "does", there is a huge risk of us eating our own bullshit.

Again, nothing against people working in this industry, and there are many in those sectors who are doing good! Just painting an opinion on a canvas of my values based on a broad-sweeping generalisation.

That said, there is a big push by the government towards innovation and product creation. And it is wholly necessary - we seem culturally and economically disinclined to do so. It make take quite sometime before change will happen - but I am slightly optimistic.
