TLDR; 

- Sustainability is a multi faceted, complex issue that fascinates me.
- It has many different interpretations and requires an intimate understanding of how the world works. 
- There is a danger of sustainable development falling victim to its own complexity.
- It helps if we were more informed and nuanced in our understanding of it.

Disclaimer - views are my own. There is no one way to think about sustainability. Some of this thinking is shaped from my background in engineering (i.e. technocentrism). I must also confess myself a cynic. (see my older post about how my views have been shaped [here](https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post26/)). This post is also designed for those not directly in the sustainability field... Although I would argue that there are some "sustainability experts" who I disagree with, for the reasons below.

### Preamble

Sustainability is a huge topic these days. And this is a great thing. There are fresh headlines (both good and bad) popping up all the time; new investments into technologies; and a steady stream of ongoing discourse about it.

Sustainability is also a top-of-mind issue amongst millennials. It is wildly popular, and I daresay "fashionable". Indeed, it was something that I myself got into as a student, joining a Green Business Society and later doing a Masters on the topic.

Yet, I have come to realise that the complexity of the issue demands a far deeper level of thought beyond the altruistic intent and "love-spreading" often found on social media. Like many other social sciences, complex issues never have one perfect answer or solution, particularly in a situations that demands serious (and I mean SERIOUS) trade-offs.

In a world divided (though from a historical perspective - it can be worse), we can all afford to be a bit more nuanced in our understanding of complex topics. 

This post aims to kick start a series of reflections that may help broaden the thinking on sustainability. Particularly, what my starting point is, and my broader concerns on the direction it is going.

### What is Sustainability?

To date, Sustainability as a concept still has wildly varying interpretations. So much so in-fact, that during my tertiary studies on this topic, one approach to understanding the issue better was through the form of book reviews. 

There is an abundance of information, frameworks and interpretations out there when defining sustainability. But rather than expound on this for three more pagefuls of research, I find myself agreeing with the definition that speaks to my utilitarian instincts the most. It is the most commonly quoted one:

> "sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"

### Why is it Important?  (and why is it so interesting?)

In my view, the importance of sustainability stretches beyond an innate desire to "save" the world. 

It is the sheer scale of the challenge that is fascinating to me for several reasons. 

First, it ~~is~~ could a powerful driver of human unification. Never in history has there been such a common goal that we, as a collective species, need to work towards. 

Second, and terrifyingly, it could be the one issue that makes or very possibly breaks our civilisation. The past thousand years of human history point towards violent outcomes in the presence of resource scarcity. It is a morbid curiosity of mine to envision and predict how this may manifest on a global scale...but I digress...

Lastly, it touches on almost all domains of human knowledge: science & technology, politics, economics, ethics, society and is somewhat related to every major global issue today. Whatever the new system or solution holds, it must account for the entire spectrum of rational (evidence backed climate impact) yet irrational (political votes). 

### Why is its Progress Threatened?

The ability to achieve Sustainable development is susceptible of falling into pitfalls along the way. Misinformation (aka fake news), greenwashing, conflict - without the constructive recognition of the trade-offs, and frankly - as I observe from time to time - outright extremism are just some of the consequences that I believe has slowed our progress. 

#### Divisiveness Over Collective Action

Rather than the unifying force it could be, I am inclined to think that sustainability remains a divisive topic that is hindering collective action (and trade offs) from being taken. As hope of the individual evolves into angst of the tribe, a narrative of blame and "us" vs "them" lines are quick to manifest. I have observed that the sustainability has been intermingled with a few other confrontational narratives:

- Young vs Old (i.e. "boomers destroyed my planet") 
- Rich vs Poor
- First World vs Third World
- Anti-Oil, Anti -Plastic vs ... (I'm not sure what the <u>realistic</u> alternative is)
- Politics (Conservative vs Liberal)
- MNC crooks
- The Patriachy
- Capitalism vs Socialism

The [Extinction Rebellion](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-49959234) and [Greenpeace's damage to Peru's Nazca Lines](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/10/peru-press-charges-greenpeace-nazca-lines-stunt) are two examples that have stuck with me as unconstructive activism.

#### The Parallels between Sustainability; Religion and Politics

So how is it that such divisions have come to pass? Over time, I reason that this boils down to a few underlying issues with sustainability.

"Sustainability" as a concept is:

- Too complex to be explained by linear logic (As much as it pains me, climate science deals with error margins and probabilities that make it tough to be widely accepted by all) 
- Aligned to an inherent moral or emotional belief system (in this case - who doesn't want to save the planet?) 

- The impact to the individual is largely intangible, and with no immediate effect (it may be years before the damage done today can be felt). 

I draw parallels between the reasoning above to two other areas that has seen increased division in recent years - Politics and religion. Both have a propensity to be drawn towards (i) cult-like figures, (ii) a belief in narrative over facts, and - as highlighted earlier - confrontation rather than collaboration with opposing views. Could sustainability fall into the same category?

Yet, unlike politics or religion, which subject to the laws of man, sustainability is subject to the whims of Mother Earth and her ticking clock. It is a problem that we are racing against time to lose.

Fascinating? Yes. Terrifying? Absolutely.

In my next post I elaborate on my thinking from an individual's perspective.

Post-Blog Post Afterpost:

The below reflects my more personal and emotive views.

I am especially "triggered" by two observations:

First are single minded organisations and individuals whose - from what I observe - sole aim is to villainise and criminalise without proposing a feasible or collaborative solution. It is a lose-lose situation, for a problem that requires a win-win mentality. Investment into smear campaigns and "shock-activism"  consequently creates a mess for the broader society to clean up.  It has left both those going about their daily lives and the activists themselves more angry and confrontational as a whole. Not a great look for the movement.

Second is the misguided hypocrisy of the modern advocate. Blindly following what is "fashionable" in the green industry (tote bags and metal straws) has generated more harm than good. (Analysis to come) Again, this is built around a circlejerk of uninformed greenies living in an echo chamber of transcendental "woke" planet-saving. It is rare to find a science-trained "influencer", in an industry premised on storytelling and not facts.

In both cases, well intentioned, terribly executed. >:(

That said, the mounting pressure from such NGOs and "influencers"- as ugly as it can be - has played a (small) part in building a new era of sustainability. Many governments have indeed taken action, though this is largely concentrated in wealthier countries - begging the question on how inclusive it is.
