My posts over the last year and a half are riddled with mistakes. 

It was a way to ensure productivity, especially at a time when I was less patient, and just more occupied with my heaspace on other things. I prioritised putting something out, or at least capturing the gist of the idea over correctness. Perfectionism is the enemy afterall.

That said, looking at my first few posts in 2022 compared to the posts these days...I can't help but feel a bit disatisfied with the frequency and egregiousness of some of the errors.

Long overdue, but I shall embark on an exercise to correct this.

#### AI Assistance
Opportunistically, I have started to use Claude.AI to support my (wide ranging) work. I've so far been impressed. 

I can totally see certain low level occupations are at risk here. The heuristic (as shared by my current house mate) is that 1 guy can do the programming work of 6. I believe it.

#### Projects to apply it on:
1. Spelling and grammar check for all my posts - ideally without changing the content or rewriting it. 
2. Perhaps help me quickly give the website a bit of a makeover? 
3. Quickly build a website idea i have in mind on Node.js
4. Day job:
	1. Translation (english, chinese, japanese)
	2. Content generation


#### Tools I'm on the look out for:
1. 3D rendering for mechanical design from text prompts (side projects)
2. Automated order and supply chain integration (Wine business)
3. Anything and everything to support the framing and writing of research papers (without getting into the big ball rat debacle)
4. Anything and everything to support a low-resource approach for building Social Media for B2B sales
