Today's post lays out some blog topics that I have been ruminating over for a while.

More subtly its another way to(hopefully) commit myself to a deadline before the end of the year.

##### Opening Thoughts
I am glad that I have managed to have kept posting over the last few days. Gotta keep the momentum going. 

I would imagine readership would be a good way of keeping motivated. Butttt thats better left for another time.

Moving forward, I think its helpful to list out my thoughts right at the start. Helps add a personal touch I suppose.
