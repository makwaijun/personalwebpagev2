### TLDR;

- Cycles hold in the past, the present and future.
- Cycles remind us that there is no perfect solution
- We regress (or progress) by switching sides.

### Cycles as a way of understanding the World

Every now and then in my conversations about the way of the world and the trends that are happening - the topic often shifts to past historical 

### Kondratieff Waves

One area of heterodox 

 Kondratieff wave is interesting. And points towards the issues of today. Why it's so uncertain. Why it's so stressful. 

But waves are humbling. 

It tells us that no one ever got it right. Our pursuit of the perfect answer is inherently flawed. 

As much as humans have fought nature. Macro forces and nature or the system will correct humanity before we can correct ourselves. 

Will we ever overcome this to form a permanent end state? Or will we huannirt forever struggle against the whims of the invisible wave.
