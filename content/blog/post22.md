TLDR;

- In the spirit of views that contrast mine 
- The support of an uncle who wished be the best of luck to work in a start-up. He worked for a local company that got acquired by a Chinese firm for 25M. He was paid well. He is now a grab driver. "Don't work from others" Opened up when I asked about his kids
- The hardcore christian mom. Anti-democratic. Anti-Chinese. Positive locally
- Ramblings of a former DY S4. 
- I should get out of the house more lol.
