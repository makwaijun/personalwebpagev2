TLDR;

- On a more lighthearted note...
- Arising from the previous post on the nonsense economy, I prioritise sector importance by what I would do if... I could control the world’s economy.

If I were hypothetically able to shape the world to my moral compass...to shape it to what I *feel* is right. How might I view it?

### F*** - indulgent, but not necessary….just nice to have. 

Characterized by Good returns to society, as a want, to live a good life.

- Media
- Experiential Wealth 
- Philosophy
- Tourism
- Cultural awareness
- Travel

The last three - I believe are crucial for Global peace and cross-border understanding

### Marry - Forever Needed

Forever needed (Critical return to society, low growth)

- Energy (one *couuuuuld* argue this was not a thing in antiquity but...)
- Healthcare
- Education
- Food (agriculture)
- Logistics and transportation

### Kill: Overrated

Characterised by Weak returns to society/environment - ticking time bombs

- Information asymmetry (management consultants, those that refine uncertainty)
- Commercial marketing and storytelling
- Pure-profit Finance and investing (as opposed to value-based)
- Advertising
- Intermediaries and Middle Men
- Most “fast” things (fast food, fashion, ecommerce, etc)

### Adopt - Structurally emergent

Underrated return to society, where demand outstrips supply - demands grooming and care

- Autism
- Wellbeing - mental or general

### Send off to boarding school -

Decentralising / Democratising - probably need to reinvent themselves

- Law (?) - just a placeholder for now, I don't have much knowledge in this field.
