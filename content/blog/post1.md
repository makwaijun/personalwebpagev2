## ..the blog is live!

If what I do is common - I tend to read the latest few posts and first post when visiting a new blog. So I better make this one count!

It took the better part of one and a half-ish days over the long weekend to get this up and running. 

I had been mulling - for a long time - on having my own personal website.

With the world relentlessly digitising, our identity, knowledge and very essence of being are being captured as bits and deconstructed binary. People upload themselves to the great omnipotent cloud through a great many channels and its clear to me why - our digital profile has been weaved in with our hearts and minds across in all aspects of life! Our jobs, relationships, hobbies, just to name a few.

Surely, one should aspire to have better control over this phenomenon? And so a personal website was the answer I was looking for.

Fairly early into the process, I preconceived this project to be a highly personalised one - a digital trail that ought be customisable and built by my own hands. As a result, I steered away from prebuilt options like Wordpress or Wix - though as a beginner, it was impossible to run away from prebuilt templates, as seen here.

In the longer run, I intend to use this site to keep track of developments in my thinking and, at the same time, be a creative outlet to track developments in my thinking over the years.  Hope this would remain active for many years to come, and be an interesting time capsule to revisit ideas new and old.

## How was this built?

From a very scrappy start (i.e. zero knowledge), there were a few main guides i followed which included:

1. [a bootstrap 4 tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkeOuwF8g8s), which piqued my interest in HTML/CSS again, since half-completing a course last Christmas.

...which I then recgonised that if my *intent* is to blog (with absolutely zero PHP/ backend knowledge), something more practical was needed.

After finding out that Static Site Generators (SSGs) could be fit for my purpose, I chose Hugo over Jekyll - just because blogger said so.

2. [how to build a website on Hugo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GnFZ8XpMak), very clear and good guide - would certainly recommend it, though I faced issues in deploying in the last step.

3. [how to create an SSH key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5qNpRGB7Qw) in a desperate attempt to fix a roadblock i faced when doing 2. I had no idea what was going on.

4. [how to deploy with netlify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBQlCtfRmqs&t=1s), since i was stuck on some git issues for gitpages which i couldn't wrap my amateur head around. Found this channel's content to be pretty good.

## Things I picked up along the way... 
---
- HTML/CSS, bootstrap 4 which was useful refresher, but not critical for this approach, Will come in handy later when i try to customise things;
- Using github and visual studio code;
- Creating an SSH Key for github (again, unnecessary);
- Jumping around command prompt, powershell, and git ... and the inumerable errors i ran into when loading adding submodules (which still doesn't work);
- Deploying the site (and buying a domain). This was by far the most confusing part for me;

and last but not least

- Writing in Markdown as I am doing right now.

## Things I would like to add...
Having ideated on some of these elements for a while, perhaps I can finally list some of these down here:

#### Sections

-  CV/ Resume (In a timeline format)
- Projects
    - Network analysis (or something related)
        - maybe on mapping skills against interdisciplinary projects?
        - email network?
    - life timeline
- Interests
    - Investments
    - Cooking
    - Youtube
     - Travel (map of where i've been + a illustrative photo?)
- Things I read


#### To do:

- [ ] Add goodreads/ other online profiles
- [ ] Add section on things i subscribe to/ like to read
- [ ] SEO - so that this site appears when my name is say googled
- [ ] Customising the layout template in Hugo (probably quite technical)
- [ ] Integrating other static pages
