## The blog is born

If what I do is common - I tend to read the latest few posts and first post when visiting a new blog. So I hope dear reader, to make this count.

It took the better part of one and a half-ish days over the long weekend to get this up and running. 

I had been mulling *for a long time* on having my own personal website.

With the world relentlessly digitising, I cannot help but feel that our very essence of being - identity, knowledge, etc are bits just waiting to be harvested. People upload themselves to the omnipotent cloud through a great many channels and its clear to me why - our digital twins has been weaved in with our hearts and minds across in all aspects of life;  Our careers, relationships, hobbies to name a few. 

Surely, one should aspire to have better control over this phenomenon? And so I endeavor to build my own website. To build a viewing window into my own mind, on my own terms. A digital footprint with WJ's stamp of approval.

Fairly early into the process, I preconceived this project to be a highly personalised one - a digital trail that ought be customisable and built by my own hands. As a result, I steered away from prebuilt options like Wordpress or Wix - though as a beginner, it was impossible to run away from prebuilt templates, as seen here.

In the longer run, I intend to use this site to keep track of developments in my thinking and, at the same time, as a creative outlet and a repository of passions.  I envision and hope that his would remain active for many years to come, and could be an interesting time capsule to revisit ideas new and old.

## How was this built?

From a very scrappy start (i.e. zero knowledge), there were a few main guides i followed below. Along the way, I recgonised that if my *intent* is to blog (with absolutely zero PHP/ backend knowledge), something more practical than a pure HTML/CSS site was needed.  After finding out that Static Site Generators (SSGs) could be fit for my purpose, I chose Hugo over Jekyll ... I just read something somewhere. Got to stay with the trends I suppose.

1. [A bootstrap 4 tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkeOuwF8g8s), which piqued my interest in HTML/CSS again, since half-completing a course last Christmas.

2. [how to build a website on Hugo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GnFZ8XpMak), very clear and good guide - would certainly recommend it, though I faced issues in deploying in the last step.

3. [how to create an SSH key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5qNpRGB7Qw) in a desperate attempt to fix a roadblock i faced when doing 2. I had no idea what was going on.

4. [how to deploy with netlify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBQlCtfRmqs&t=1s), since i was stuck on some git issues for gitpages which i couldn't wrap my amateur head around. Found this channel's content to be pretty good.

## Things I picked up along the way... 
---
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap 4 which was useful refresher, but not critical for this approach. Will nonetheless come in handy later when i try to customise things;
- Using github and visual studio code;
- Creating an SSH Key for github (again, unnecessary);
- Jumping around command prompt, powershell, and git ... and the inumerable errors i ran into when loading adding submodules (which still didn't work);
- Deploying the site (and buying a domain). This was by far the most confusing part for me; and
- Writing in Markdown as I am doing right now.
