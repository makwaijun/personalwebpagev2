#### TLDR;

- A digital identity is critical in this day and age, but it is often too easy to lose control of it.
- Instead, we should take control of our own digital narrative by designing and customising a personal website.
- I explain how I did so.

#### Conception

If what I do is common - I tend to read the latest few posts and first post when visiting a new blog. So I hope dear reader, to make this count.

It took the better part of one and a half-ish days over the long weekend to get this up and running. 

I had been mulling *for a long time* to built my own website.

The world is relentlessly digitising.

It is almost impossible to thrive in the modern world without having our very essence of being - identity, knowledge, and more - digitised in some way . People upload themselves to the omnipotent cloud through a great many channels, giving birth to a digital twin. For better or worse, this twin represents us across all aspects of life;  Our careers, relationships, hobbies to name a few. 

I believe that there is much more to an individual than curated pictures, comments and memes. This digital twin however, is a hollow shell. Lacking the heart and warmth of ourselves. 

So how does one fill this shell? 

In an attempt to do so, I endeavoured to build my own website. To build a viewing window into my own mind and on my terms. A digital footprint with WJ's stamp of approval.

Fairly early into the process, I preconceived this project to be a highly personalised one - a digital trail that ought be customisable and built by my own hands. As a result, I steered away from prebuilt options like Wordpress or Wix - though as a beginner, it was impossible to run away from prebuilt templates, ~~as seen here ~~ (update: adapted to make my own Hugo template).

In the longer run, I intend to use this site to keep track of developments in my thinking, a creative outlet and a repository of passions.  I envision and hope that his would remain active for many years to come. It would be an interesting time capsule to revisit ideas new and old.

#### How this was built

From a very scrappy start (i.e. zero knowledge), there were a few main guides i followed below. Along the way, I recgonised that if my *intent* is to blog (with absolutely zero PHP/ backend knowledge), something more practical than a pure HTML/CSS site was needed.  After finding out that Static Site Generators (SSGs) could be fit for my purpose, I chose Hugo over Jekyll ... I just read something somewhere. Got to stay with the trends I suppose.

1. [A bootstrap 4 tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkeOuwF8g8s), which piqued my interest in HTML/CSS again, since half-completing a course last Christmas.
2. [how to build a website on Hugo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GnFZ8XpMak), very clear and good guide - would certainly recommend it, though I faced issues in deploying in the last step.
3. [how to create an SSH key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5qNpRGB7Qw) in a desperate attempt to fix a roadblock i faced when doing 2. I had no idea what was going on.
4. [how to deploy with netlify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBQlCtfRmqs&t=1s), since i was stuck on some git issues for gitpages which i couldn't wrap my amateur head around. Found this channel's content to be pretty good.

Other [guides]( https://flaviocopes.com/start-blog-with-hugo/) [i didn't](https://zwbetz.com/make-a-hugo-blog-from-scratch/) [quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6xpOpKBZ2k) [get through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-i5rZwlfu4).

## Things I picked up along the way... 
---
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap 4 which was useful refresher, but not critical for this approach. Will nonetheless come in handy later when i try to customise things;
- Using github and visual studio code;
- Creating an SSH Key for github (again, unnecessary);
- Jumping around command prompt, powershell, and git ... and the innumerable errors when loading adding submodules (which still didn't work);
- Deploying the site (and buying a domain). This was by far the most confusing part for me; and
- Writing in Markdown (as I am doing right now).
