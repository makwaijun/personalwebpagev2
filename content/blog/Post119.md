*Another ancient draft post dug up. Time to recall and dig up the memories....*

### Thoughts and Preamble

Some thoughts i had before going in:

* Solitary Quarantines are a strange thing. 
- It made me wonder - for people of my generation these days, how those conditioned to hyperstimulation would be able to handle it. 
- Also considered that solitary confinement would seem far more punishing on the human psyche than at any point prior in history.
- I also approached it with a sense of experimentation, and how i would take it.

### Background

I stayed in the Mercure Hotel. Which was nice, as a business traveller hotel. If i rememebr correctly, we stayed for 14 days. I was with my CEO at the time.

#### Getting there:

The rough sequence was: disembarking from the plane, being herded through a fixed route. Getting a nasty nasal swab test, going through immigration, eventually reaching a section with various booths representing different areas (qu). A bus, equipped with all manners of plastic flaps came to get us. 

The booths were kitted out with touristy marketing for each of the regions which was a well meaning attempt to welcome people within such circumstances. 

I think we got off the plane at 9pm, and reached the hotel at 3am.

#### Routine:
- Morning swab test (mouth)
- Fairly fixed mealtimes, notified by a knock on the door.

#### Physiological
- I drink about 4L of water within 36 hours or so. I suppose tha . Chapped lips did nudge me to drink a lot more.
- I put in effort to keep my body active. Following Jordan Yeoh's 30 or so minute programme.
- Food was fairly routine:
	- Breakfast: Porridge with salted pickles, a bao, corn on the cob
	- Lunch, Dinner: Rice with a meat, veg and tofu dish. Often similar seasonings
	- I practically ate everything given except the corn. The super oily Ma La seasoning was great. 
	- Brought my own instant noodles (tom yum kokaaaaa) and chocolate which helped with flabour diversity too

#### Guest Experience


- There was a wechat group set up to make requests
- Man, some people can be needy and whiny as hell (asking for new toothbrushes or toilet paper for what seemed like everyday)
- But the majority were fairly normal
- Able to order other stuff off the menu, but i didnt dare try due to anxiety around payment and communication 
- Able to order delviery in, but i didnt dare, for the same reason above

#### What was Illegal 
- Knives (even fruit knives)
-  Alcohol 
- Hot food (only processed food or fruits were allowed to be delivered)
Interesting.....

#### Psychological
- Constant, baseline anxiety
- Day 1 anxiety soon gave way to an introvert's bliss
- But after Day 6, i started to feel it....
- Would call friends /family on occasion, to stay sane too.
- Also took up daily Mandarin lessons - as a means of being productive too
- Can't recall if i brough at gaming devices. Brought two books if i remember correctly (finished one of them at least)

#### Chinese and China Experience 

- This was interesting: My chinese was (is) terrible, and the not-Chinese and gestures could only get you so far. Had to stay calm, and be resourceful enough to figure things out. 
- Need for a local phone number and apps engrained in super insular system. Very little support for foreigners using local apps during this period (a year later, its improved a lot since then)
- Working staff just did their jobs just to the extent where they won't get in trouble. Had to do certain things (zero flexibility), but also unsure how to address off-the-book requests.


Just documenting and immortalising the memory...was certainly and experience.
