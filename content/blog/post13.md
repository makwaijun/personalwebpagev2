I will first lay out a thesis I have had about how the global economy has been shaped and grown over the course of history.

Unifying theories (Read consilience) are useful, albeit 

An enigma well studied over the course of time. It has never been "correct" for human beings are never rational. 

**It is immeasurably important.** 

I stare at it in the course of my work. 

I see it hustling and bustling. In the markets. Along the highways. On digital media.

**It is stressful to read**. Media  reports on the economy could either reassure, strike fear, or be 

Does this warrant a full discipline and academic study? I'm not sure. For abstractions on the economy go beyond what the scientific method is capable of handling.

## My World View on the Global Economy

#### Chapter 0: A retroactive unifying theory of development

1. Understanding mazlowe hierachy, and the structures around it
   a. Bottom (food, energy, infra,health care)
   b. Top (anything "green", preachy wellness)

These are differentiated by 

A Supposition on the Eras of Economic Development

1. The eras of economic growth: Hype bubbles and the great decoupling of human needs with the economy.
2. The recent tipping point and the end of real value
3. The eventual rise of the nonsense economy, rent-seeking and the death of the craft
4. Why "making" is critical to the economy and the soul



### Chapter 1: The State of the World Today

#### Business Hiring and the Social Compact

Incompatability of the indian caste system in Singapore. and the HR practices around thse

Rather than 

1) Business built on a culture that is opposite to

#### The Rise of the Nonsense Economy

The eventual rise of the nonsense economy, rent-seeking and the death of the craft

Core goods and even services are all commodities to meet the lower level of Mazlowe's hierachy.

Despite its grave importance, these activities 

The proliferation of met-basic needs has led to a freemium economy. Where immediate value is not demanded by a producer. (Surely, this must have been unthinkable from a historical perspective)

What differentiates products is now:

1) Marketing and advertising to capture customers that are faced with multiples of similarly priced and quality products.

What this means:

1. True game-changing innovations will remain rare. This observation is often masked by hype.
2. Profitability will continue to be squeezed. These are not dividend companies.

Hype bubbles and the great decoupling of human needs with the economy.

#### Why "making" is critical to the economy and the soul

### Chapter 2: T

#### The Economic Pump is Changing

Static value vs free debt and cash. (read deficit myth)

#### The Incentives and Optimal 

The Freemium future; monetisation

#### The Have and Have nots

The global divide: The grand theory of surviving and thriving in a non-zero sum world. Capital spending has decoupled from job creation and distribution. This is one part of the systems loop that has broken down. Geographically, there will be a divide. Countries after years of exploitation (guised under development) may permanently not be able to catch up.

### Chapter 3: The outlook for the future

#### Continual dynamics

#### Steady state - Humanity Progresses(?) into a protected end state

- The economic cycle largely holds. However, 
- How recent crises have pointed towards a steady state of the future.
- The producing elites vs the consuming masses. The emergence of a global class divide.

#### The Rat Race of Humanity - Which will win first?
