I will first lay out a thesis I have had about how the global economy has been shaped and grown over the course of history.

How does one view the economy.

An enigma well studied over the course of time. It has never been "correct" for human beings are never rational. 

**It is immeasurably important.** 

I stare at it in the course of my work. 

I see it hustling and bustling. In the markets. Along the highways. On digital media.

**It is stressful to read**. Media  reports on the economy could either reassure, strike fear, or be 

Does this warrant a full discipline and academic study? I'm not sure. For abstractions on the economy go beyond what the scientific method is capable of handling.

## My World View on the Global Economy

#### Part 1: Transacting Economic Value, by Meeting Human Needs

1. Understanding mazlowe hierachy, and the structures around it
   a. Bottom (food, energy, infra,health care)
   b. Top (anything "green", preachy wellness)

These are differentiated by 



A Supposition on the Eras of Economic Development



1. The eras of economic growth: Hype bubbles and the great decoupling of human needs with the economy.
2. The recent tipping point and the end of real value

4. Why "making" is critical to the economy and the soul



#### Part 4: The current steady state

Core goods and even services are all commodities to meet the lower level of Mazlowe's hierachy.

The proliferation of met-basic needs has led to a freemium economy. Where immediate value is not demanded by a producer. (Surely, this must have been unthinkable from a historical perspective)

What differentiates products is now:

1) Marketing and advertising to capture customers that are faced with multiples of similarly priced and quality products.



What this means:

1. True game-changing innovations will remain rare. This observation is often masked by hype.

2. Profitability will continue to be squeezed. These are not dividend companies.

#### Part 5: What about Recessions? 

The economic cycle largely holds. However, 



**how will countires survive? rethinking economic development**

THe grand theory of survivng and thirving in a non-zero sum world.

Capital spending has decoupled from job creation and distribution. This is one part of the systems loop htat has broken down.
