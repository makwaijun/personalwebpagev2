#### TLDR;

- Economic development and technological advancement can be broken down - *fairly well* - into emergent domains that correspond to a particular time era.
- Capital flows to these distinct "domains", or as I term it: "engines of growth". This is where jobs are created, innovation is nurtured, companies are most profitable. It is largely driven by the need to differentiate.
- Each domain is additive & complementary to pre-existing domains. Consequently, there will be increasing permutations and an added complexity to attain growth.
- The contribution of these contemporary engines of growth are diminishing as intangibles are increasingly valued. There is a decoupling of human needs vis-a-vis the future engines of growth.

#### Preamble

There are two fundamental trends underpinning this line of thinking.

First, is that Capitalism (as long as it exists) will always find an "excuse" for higher growth.

Second, and in a similar vein, is that Businesses will always pivot to thrive in the latest and greatest trends. Businesses will adapt to remain profitable over many decades.

#### A hypothesis. Indulge me.

Consider that that "eras" of economic development can be roughly modelled by certain themes or domains. 

In antiquity, **Consumption** was the primary socio-economic activity. Foraging. Consumption of food and relatively raw materials.

Subsequently, **Resource Development** was the next frontier of development. It involved cultivating the land, extracting ores from the earth.

Next, **Manufacturing** emerged. Artisans of the bronze age converted raw products and goods into useful tools. Pottery, metallurgy, woodworking are examples of this (thanks age of empires/ civilization V for the history lesson).

Following which (oh my, I'm running out of synonyms for "next"), advances in globalisation sparked a shift towards **global supply chains**. All forms of economic activity was no longer premised on efficiency alone. Instead, economic activities were optimised based on location (and in many early cases, where labour was the cheapest).

Afterwhile (I'm desperate), **Modern services** emerged. Advertising, accounting and the professionalisation of corporate functions (HR, Finance, etc) became the next big thing.

More recently (taking the easy way out here), **Digital**, **Innovation** and now **Sustainability** have emerged as core domains. 

*I wish i could have visually depicted the above, but alas its a little tricky using Hugo*

#### Features of each trend 

Businesses who want to prolong their competitiveness and grow often do so in two ways. 

They either enter new emerging markets (Currently Asia)
