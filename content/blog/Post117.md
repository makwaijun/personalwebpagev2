### Moving to Obsidian

After a scare (of dynalist logging me out randomly, and me being terrified of losing alllll my notes from many years).

I've decided to move off Dynalist and move onto Obisidian (which, coincidentally, are made by the same developers)

Some immediate features I've noted:

1. All around, more powerful, and feature rich...I've barely scratched the surface treating it primarily as a note taking app
2. Allows me to write into markdown directly (i.e. i can directly copy paste into my website uploads, as opposed to the extensive formatting i needed to do last time)
3. I love the knowledge graph feature, which was also the exact feature and visualisation i like to understand complexity and the cross-over of ideas:

	1. I may need to spend time Importing back a huge amount of Posts into obsidian and # tagging extensively...this will take time but I'd be curious what the graph looks like
	2. I'll probably need to specify a taxonomy of tagging or clustering ideas. Whether such as themes, toolkits, or concepts.

	
### Examination of Post Publishing
Since I'm reflecting on note-taking and blog post-synthesis, I'll throw in a few thoughts on my tracking list that i had never gotten around to publish.

In essence, the approach to Topics, whether economics, sustainability , etc can be approached through three lenses:

1. A Historical examination, paying due respect the the Universal Framework of Cycles , that similar (albeit not exactly the same) moments have happned throughout the history of mankind and the universe

2. Do a Scientific Examination, with the most common method being Back of the Envelope Calculations

3. Do a Human Condition Examination, which often acts as a foil to the rationality of the Scientific Examination. For Example, was used to explain the energy and cryptocurrency dimensions. 

These offer three variabilities of "realities". 

To have: A historian, scientist and sociologist walk into a bar....what a marvel that would be. I would pay money just to listen in. 

One of the "reference blogs" that obisidian showcased was by a former academic (Indian guy, but spent a long time working in Singapore....who would've thought) who had a rather nice framework on describing his systematic approach from ideas to publishing using a Coffee process: Something to the effect of Raw Beans => to Ground => to brewed => to a cup of coffe.
