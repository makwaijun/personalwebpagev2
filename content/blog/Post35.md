TLDR;

- Economic development and technological advancement across mankind's history can be framed as "chapters".
- Chronologically order, each Chapter highlights the dominant economic activity of its time.
- This was/ is the ultimate driver of job creation, profits, and innovation - core aspects of any economy.

### **PREMISE 1:  GLOBAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CAN BE BROKEN DOWN INTO SEMI-DISCRETE SEGMENTS**

On one hand, the global economy is an enigmatic force. 

It is constantly reshaping - creating and destroying wealth, lives and countries. Yet, when looked at from a historical perspective and if abstracted to a high-enough level, patterns also emerge. Therefore this first Premise supposes that the global economy has evolved (constantly changing) over long periods of time through certain somewhat-discrete eras - defined here as “chapters”. 

This approach builds on my initial plan to think critically with the[ assistance of history](https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post27/). Though viewing[ economic development* through eras is not new](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostow's_stages_of_growth), the abstractions to the global level and the observations of each are hopefully novel, in this post and others.

*Although "Economic Development" is often used in the context of countries, this framework takes the bigger-picture approach to understand how the global economy evolved across time and countries. This takes the perspective of human civilisation in its* *entirety**, rather than that of select communities.*

### Chapters can be defined through its dominant economic activity.

As described, I believe that, when abstracted to a high-enough level, patterns can emerge. This paves the way to cluster certain periods of time into a segment. Within this, I define each chapter by the predominant economic activity of its time. 

The characteristics of this activity are as follows: 

- **Strong economic profitability,** as organisations are able to differentiate themselves and out-compete due to the above.

- **High investment**, resources, investment and effort flow towards the predominant economic activity.

- **High job creation potential**, both in terms of quantity and quality. In other words, there are new ways to create value for society. 

- **Socio-economic premium**, as individuals working in these sectors do comparatively well.

- **Emergence of specialised hubs**, as agglomerations of assets and people working in these sectors outperform other locations.

  on.

All points are in **relative** terms, meaning that multiple economic activities can co-exist - just that one is better than another. These points also capture a key concept underpinning this framework - **Differentiation**.

< as a reminder to self: Points 5 and 6 breeds domestic inequality and international inequality, for the future post>

### There are Seven  Principle Economic Activities that have come to Define each Chapter

Applying the characteristics above, I suppose that the global economy has been evolved through the following chapters:

- Consumption
- Resource Development
- Manufacturing and Craftsmanship
- Global Trade
- Modern Services
- Digitalisation
- Platforms

I am aware of the recency bias for some of these chapters (platforms for example), but I believe they have been profoundly impactful to justify their inclusion into the list. Otherwise, just as this post explained the discrete/consistent patterns observed to *define* chapters, the next post adds on a further layer of commentary onto each of these.This more or less ends this post by summarising the principles of defining each chapter, but for a lengthier exposition of each of these chapters, please read on.
