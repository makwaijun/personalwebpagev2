TLDR;

- Each chapter has implications to how businesses are structured
- Each chapter is additive and complementary, and not necessarily destructive
- This has led to increasing permutations of where value is found

### Sub-Observation 2: The Birth and Death of each Chapter

So how and why do Chapters emerge? I suggest one hypothesis, which hinges on the core concept of differentiation.

emergence, differentiation, profitability, commoditisation and consolidation.

emergence, profitability, commoditisation and consolidation.

Each chapter begins with the emergence of a new technology that undergoes mass adoption - a revolution - that is able to break the systems of the past and reforms a new one anchored around itself. What follows is a shift in political and financial (i.e. investment) attention to the new system.

As the core phenomenon begins as a novelty but later widely adopted, commoditisation of the once-new good or service naturally occurs. Businesses in 

In many cases, there is a systemic shift that propels. 





### 



The role of business in each chatper.

Take Royal Dutch Shell for example. 

Its core activities covers Oil extraction (Resource Development) in a heavily, heavily consolidated industry. It has specialisations and critical roles in trading (Chapter 4); refines oil into higher value products (Craftmanship)



TLDR:



- Each domain is additive & complementary to pre-existing domains. Consequently, there will be increasing permutations and complexities required to achieve growth.
- The contribution of these contemporary engines of growth are increasingly intangible. 



### The response of Businesses

- More recently (taking the easy way out here), Digital, Innovation and now Sustainability have emerged as core domains. 

- I wish i could have visually depicted the above, but alas its a little tricky using Hugo

- Features of each trend 

- Businesses who want to prolong their competitiveness and grow often do so in two ways. 

- 

#### Commoditisation...



#### ...and the consequent Consolidation, Merges and Acquisitions



#### Evolution of Corporate functions



### Redefining innovation: The Pursuit of many Permutations

As a consequence of each phase being additive in nature..



There are increasing permutstkons of buzzwords and interest areas. This remains to be a place where value is derived.





### The Great Acceleration - Writing Chapters Faster

As the mysterious author with a ink-smudged invisible hand, I believe he is currently writing the chapter in the following:

### So... What's Next?

I hypothesize that the business cycles (who are the ultimate creators, deployers and appliers of new technology) point towards the early signs of where we are in terms of the next chapter. I feel that there are currently three in the making, all at different stages of being written. 

#### Sustainability 



#### Platforms

These chapters have helped me frame economic history fairly well - but I suspect that there are reasons why this model is being fundamentally disrupted.
