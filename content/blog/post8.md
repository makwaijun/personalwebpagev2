#### Opening Thoughts

Slept late last night - cracking my head over some issues. Not terribly productive today, but had been somewhat looking forward to finishing this today. Ended up reading a light book on military history before bed, delaying bedtime that bit more. 



## Cracked Heads and  Eye Bags

Ran into several issues while doing this.

1. d3.js library was initially not working with some demo code. Resolution: setting the right version of d3. As it turns out, there were major changes in how data is imported between version 4 and version 5.
2. Unsure of how to navigate the hugo structure to host data files statically. Resolution: host the file statically on github. Call it in the raw format. Saves having to host it on netlify too (every bit counts)
