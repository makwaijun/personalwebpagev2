-   This post is on The Tragedy of the Real Economy & the Rise of the Nonsense Economy"
-   TLDR;
    -   Mazlowe described a framework of human needs. There are things that are tangible and essential, just as there are things that are intangible and non-essential (self-fulfilment/ transcendence).
    -   As marketing becomes the key differentiator in a world where material functionality is commoditised, there is a real risk of pervasive bullshit (I am yet to read a [seminal piece](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466958-bullshit-jobs) on this).
    -   Yet, in the pursuit of growth, capital will continue to flow to such areas. This I term, is the rise of the "Nonsense Economy". It is the new frontier of rent-seeking behaviour.

-   Recognising the Strengths of the Current System
    -   It is important to recognise that the series of essays is not meant to take a shit on the current system.
-   Our system is built for innovation. And has done so very well. But this system is very poor at allocation. We have all the tools we need to create a good standard of living.
-   The shifting Sands
    -   The Storytelling Premia, and the laggard engineer.
-   How many modern day workers truly know where their food comes from? where their energy comes from? how their fundamental basic needs are met?
-   Just as industries and companies climb up the value chain, so is the rich economy following mazlowe's hierachy.
-   The Dterminants of the future economy
-   For the future economy; key determinants - minimum scale threshold (for things to be competitor edge. Such that there are benefits)
-   Middle class - materialism and luxurism.
-   You need a pump by profit or pump by cheap debt. This flows the economy.

-   The cheap cash normal
    -   Keynsian theory of savings glut, ie transfer of cash, spending etc. How does this relate to the fundamental traffic problem? One slowdown in a sector makes the average speed decrease. Similarly, one actor in the economy can make the entire cash flow of spending decrease. Both slow down because of external stimuli, ie an accident or increased prices.Â 
    -   Education and competition and pressure

-   However, industry should develop "value", providing good service for a reasonable cost to consumers and the firm. Currently, wealth inequality makes it difficult for the millenial generation to concentrate wealth together. for the same amount of wealth, it, although still inequal has been distributed to minimise the impact. Now, bar China, there is more focus on experiential wealth rather than material wealth, and hence trends are pointing towards lower material profit maximisation, for value maximisation of intangible benefits.
