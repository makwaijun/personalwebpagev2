I finished the book [Old Path White Clouds](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/241899). 

Can't say I've been reading too much these days, but it was leant by someone else, and I had intended to return it. He is someone kind in his demeanour to faces old and new. A silent gravitas in patience and experience. Non judgemental. Not really a close contact, nor an acquaintance. A figure assoicated with fishing.


There isn't too much to this post, other than it being a cheat sheet for future reference.
