In 2021, I wrote two series: based on my thoughts around Sustainability and around economics. In 2022, and perhaps a sign of my interest diverting away from thinking about the external world, but into the internal realms, i started to write more about life, human nature, and career.

I would certainly say that 2023 was quite heavily oriented around work (and I am somewhat self-impressed that I managed to write 27 posts).  As I started typing this, and its already almost the end of October with only 6 posts uploaded. 

But the inquisitive mind and the overt, if not excessive energy spent thinking about work, would be a waste if not for (just the usual) intellectual synthesis and learnings from my own lived experienced, theoretical hearsay, and from the mistakes both done and observed. Indeed, it has been quite the exposure observing MNCs, Government jobs, startup and scaleup companies, and would perhaps serve as a playbook for that I could use in the future.

This initial post is to help structure this series, and find a way to categorise the sheer amount of just "stuff" and thoughts collected over time. It's far more likely that these would be general lists of key heuristics and principles, rather than a textbook in itself. 

The below themes are listed in no particular order of priority: 

1. On Leadership (originally written in early 2023)
2. On  Management (down, up, across and everything in between)
3. On Revenue Generation, Sales
4. On Finance and Accounting
6. On Considerations at Different company life stages
7. On Building Systems, Processes and Policies
8. On HR culture, hiring
9. On Production (Manufacturing) - doing things repeatedly well
10. On Business Development
11. On Marketing
12. On Risk
13. On Research, Engineering and Product Development
14. On Strategy - Vertical Integration

 But there will always remain some gaps, and these will need to filled in at some point
