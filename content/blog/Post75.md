There will soon be several weekends by which I would locked up in a room. Best play catch up for several posts I've been meaning to complete. 

These are a wide and varied bunch to get through... Bolded ones prioritised (deemed doable). Its a shame for the others - I find that I have forgotten the sprightly thinking and ideas behind a few draft posts.  

#### Very old 
(conceived more than 2 years ago)
These can be added to a series on Politics/ political thought:
- Political models in the Information / digital age: Hmm I should read around this topic more before tackling it.
- The duality of truth: Interesting, could probably probe this from a political perspective. Paradoxical.


Economics:
- **On Making Work, Work:** Thought piece on Human capital. This is doable. 
- On REITS: Needs more research - my hunch is that REITS are not good for society. 

Hobby:
- **The theory of games**: Can add this to the series on Games - around progress, competiton...design, etc.  Maybe lsiting down my GOAT Games. 

Other: 
- **On Intellectual curiosity** :  Needs more to expand on. Perhaps to define it, and describe its benefits? Maybe stick on something around **intellectual honesty**, bacon's four idols.
-**On Satisficing**:  Right tech vs high -tech

##### Old
*Conceived sometime last year or so*
- The Productivity Paradox: I'd like to write a damn economics thesis on this. Too far out for now :(.
- The Drivers and Thrivers of inequality: Could probably expand my thinking a bit on this from the previous post on inequality. 

#### Recent
*Conceived over the last year*

Politics: 
- Lessons from the Qin, Chu and Han: needs a lot more resarch and musings from Chinese history.

Other: 
- On Fashion - Life After Uniqlo: Probably need an inspired moment on fashion to look at this again.

**Start a series on Human Nature:**
- Contextualised Brilliance: Working theory for some people
- On Racism, backlash and caste: Hypotheses on caste mindsets
- On Privilege: Story and reflections
- On Vanity and accidental heroism: story time...
- Akrasia: just sorta like this word, very relatable


**Re-label the Career series to something broader, and add:**
- Management
- Hiring
- Where I wish more people would work in, heh.

Geopolitics:
- **Pax Technologica**

**Energy:**
- Could start a series, why i like it, its revolutionary status, what the steady state looks like

Other:
- Polymathism: A lot more research needed.
- Muses, Musaea and Longevity: on long lasting instituions, companies, technology (redundancy vs cost)


Lets gooo! Perhaps 10 - 15 posts are doable over the next month. Lots more to research and read for other topics however. Its been a long time since I last read a book...
