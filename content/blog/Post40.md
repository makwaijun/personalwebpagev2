...Which I think is a natural question that follows. 

Looking at the business cycles and [the criteria](https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post35/) I had laid out to define what a dominant economic activity looks like - I foresee two new chapters emerging in the short term. 

1. Sustainability
2. Quantum

If we described quantum as the new “digital”, and sustainability as a necessity, I am fairly certain of these trends.

Neither should really be a surprise, though I believe they are still too nascent in my mind to be considered a full chapter at this stage.  Sustainability may see it becoming dominant in the next five years, and quantum, after that. 

But, like I described in my first post - the nature of economic thinking has been touted as outdated, and despite my best attempts to develop this governing framework, I am not fully confident of this model being able to explain everything we see and what might be coming next.

Again, I can’t tell how many articles I’ve read recently by experts that have shifted from logic to opinion; certainty to confusion. Titles which begin with “Making Sense of…” are indicators of this.

Why is this so? 

If these first four posts set out some thoughts on the governing rules from a *historical* perspective, the subsequent posts would aim to convey why things are different in the *future* and why there remain many things that are inexplicable in conventional terms.
