This is a compilation of word snippets and musings, while on the trip.


#### On the Highways from Milanpensa

Adolation of symmetry

Man belongs in nature
Wrapped by sheet cliffs of green.   

Columns of broad shouldered Europeans
Mountainous like the ranges
Paths cycling  
A love of the outdoors 
Hiking, biking 

But man too needs to suffer,
Straining up steep roads 
Braving the elements

The artifice of putting ourselves in nature, 
and the artifice of our self made constraints of modernity

We seek artificial suffering in nature, to free our selves from the artificial suffering of self-imposed constraints to
feel more, 
to grow
to learn


### Kronplatz, 1 jun

A blue mist cradles the bright sun 
White capped peaks. 
A pause of tranquility 
The darkness of the rocks
Filtered like a sunlight polaroid

Shimmering glaciers
With silver emblazoned 
On kintsugi crevasses
Recycling, redoing 
As another season comes 
And another chapter goes 

Aside from the chirps of birds. 
They might have nested in 
the steel turbines, aside the path.

Fat bottomed ants, emerging in the summer. 
The richest of purple flowers, open and alluring for business. 
Too long have I touched natural ice
The clearness of water

The cover of clouds
Round and round the hill it goes
Like a concentric fort that extends
And around each peak. 
Like the Siege of Alesia

#### While Driving

Do we drive alone?
Or build a silent affinity to those on the autoway
Looking at cars behind.  Or in front.
Tailed for hours in jams and highways
Friendly rivals in speed. 
I match yours if you match mine 
with wonder.
Where did they come from. 
Where are they going.
 and so they exit
 and the link that never was, breaks.

### On one of the Mountains

The exhalations and breaths of the mountain
Yawning
Wispy smoke like portrusions 
Gazing gorges
Alpine expressions
Warmth of the sun

In a icy cool breeze. Refreshing
Air of life
Water of life.
Rushing streams
Green, white gray
Brown and black

### Still Driving

The Inquality of Highways
The red and white pillars seering over this
Different speeds, different lanes
Hungarian haul trucks
Giving way to Alfa Romeos and Porsches on the highway

#### Three sisters hike and on the Dolomites region

There was a Flow of the hike on rocks.
Not to baby her too*
 
Dolomites seems tourism done right.
Enoufg wealth spillover that people tax and tip.
For the greater commons.
But will pensioners money run out?
Area for the rich, that is the best of nature colonised by the rich.
Hear the wind
And the valleys below
Devoid of the clutter and corruption
The average age is old.
I was reminded of what it means to be Al dente

### The First Hike

We learnt 

That one side is volcanic (alpine)
One side is chalk based (dolomites)
So different lake colour. (blue vs green).
The guide says Water is Life
Hiking while. Listening to running water in silence. Is good for mental health

Maltese couple - also English speaking
A beautiful remark 
Not only respect in death
But respect in life

(Referring to bringing one's parents or loved ones for experiences without crisis/reason/trigger)
