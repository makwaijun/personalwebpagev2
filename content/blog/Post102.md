As I draw closer towards permanance and consistency, in accordance with the rightful or wrongful ossification of my beliefs; 

while at the same time, forseeing the inevitable curiosity and interest of my peers into the markings of the flesh;

How does a man think of inscribing that on their inherited birthright of skin with conviction?
 
Principally, I feel strongly about two universal frameworks: of Cycles and Systems, though I largely approach this in a scientific and geometric pattern-spotting sorta of way, as opposed to the Buddhist Dharma-esque approach which indeeds captures such thinking too.

### The Theory of Cycles:

In my own rambly deifintion: 
> Cycles, as defined by a sequence of data points forming a line, amplitude, and frequency, that is continuous, changing, capturing both past and present

The Theory of Cycles is a good reminder of:

* Change is always constant, and one has to be adaptable
* There are changes in the intensity (amplitude) and frequency (..aka...frequency) of change.
* There are periods of volatility and stability, depending on how frequent changes are
* There are steady states and Step changes, depending on how major the amplitudes change
* Life, indeed has its up and downs. 
* There is humility in the ever-changing cycles - what was a correct response in the past may not be the correct response today
* Yet, there are also lessons to be learnt from past cycles (i.e. history is a teacher, and some times has repeating patterns)
* Resilience to cycles can be defined by upper or lower thresholds (i.e. horizontal line)

#### Application:

I've used this to describe other universal concepts such as
[Economics](https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post38/) or
Sustainability - *we often talk about points of no return (when amplitude change is irreversibly high), and the system does not have the capacity to self-correct*

But such thinking can apply to mood as well:

Feeling low, feeling high; cathartic / mental breaks occur when amplitude change is temporarily at a peak. 

Many blocks of stress in the same time period can cause  "limits" or threshoholds to be breached when the amplitude of stress / worry is too high. 

Naturally, I suppose my pursuit for discomfort zones has often times created an environment of high amplitude and high frequency change. Something that leans against my physical and mental durability. 

### The Theory of Systems:

Also, in own rambly definition: 

> Systems, as defined by non-linear complex networks of interrelated entities; best illustrated as a series of interconnected dots and lines

The Theory of systems is a good reminder of:

* There is always a reason and things explained by underlying causes
* Problems have root causes, and may only surface on the second, third, fourth degree
* A first degree response may have unintended consequences (or other *spillover effects*)
* There are almost __always__ [trade offs](https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post88/)
* There is very little linearity in life

#### Application:

Again, I've used it to describe the interrelations of various universal frameworks in the past.

Its a concept I've also applied to understand people better - what drives them to behave in a certain way? Thereasons could possibly be due to nearer term second or third order reasons; or fourth order theories on their childhood and upbringing. Some applied psychoanalysis if you will.

It probably preoccupies my mind too much - but indeed, I have a fascination with the interconnectedness of things.

Surely that should bear enough weight to provide sufficient conviction to get a tattoo on some graphical representation of these concepts...

Of course, the subsequent question is where...
