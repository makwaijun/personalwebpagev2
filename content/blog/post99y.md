This ought to be a live document, but as this every growing repository of my thoughts continues to be built, I thought it better to capture these, in the moment. 


### Say What and Wants; Outcomes vs Outputs
Idea 1: confusing outcomes and output. Don't be focused on the output, if the outcome is achieved 
Idea 2: be an orchestrator. Can't play all instruments, 
Idea 3: ask what needs to be removed? What friction to be lubricated. Have an oil flask, not a fire extinguisher 

Communicate intent
Teach skills
Communication is not a solution, unless each of them have a founder mindset - which will be severely tested over time. 
There are inherent trade offs and dynamics in people wanting to do their job, or their scope of work. 
Remove bottlenecks 
Let things run itself


### Processes and Systems

Implement systems
Spend time to think about the bigger picture and deployment of resources   '

Align objectives 
Never talk up
Don't do, get things done. See things through 

If an authority gives a window to get out of a meeting - take it. 

### The Conductor and the Orchestra
Harmony

To make good music. 



On sales:
Never talk up. Talk as an equal


### Hiring Good People

Having since joined a startup, I've been thrown - earlier than I expected - into the shoes of a hirier. 
I'm an advocate  of generalism. There are two driving forces behind this
Everything can be googled, and everything can be taught via a youtube lecture. An novice can follow along the actions of an expert to figure things out.
More than ever, there is a proliferation of free / cheap, accessible softwares
I prio
Some of my questions include:
X
Y
Z
I feel satisfied when a candidate takes a moment to reflect as in deep thought. It is this depth of thought that can unearth a hidden understanding that is good for both the candidate, and for the company too. 
I think its been successful too - Some feedback of candidates has described the interview with me as a "great chat". 


Combining these, careers and hiring represent a race that balances three aspects. These are to acclerate the pursuit of the best (culture) fit for the best job with the best person, in the best place.
