I recently revisited sthe concept of intuition. I've been holding on to a strong belief that intuition comes with a certain wisdom. I'm not saying that intuition is better than logic per se. But I believe there's a natural progression where people transition from idealistic logic to a matured form of quality "intuition".

Just like wine, I see the complexity and irrationality (difficult to describe) as a natural conclusion for people who start to make sense of things but ultimately realise that our minds are simply unable to comprehend and decide across spectrums and the myriads of possibilities

#The Idealism of youth 
When young, and idealistic,  there is a tendency to see the world in the best things can be. We're taught reason: and conclusively, there are things that must be right and things that are wrong - just as its inked in instructed black and white text books.

I'd like to think that we sused to be straight supermarket chardonnays, simply defined with lemon and green fruits. It's coloured by certainty  
 
#The intuition of age

But the world is immeasurably complex if one is observant enough about it, and the more these can be expressed by numerous grays and spectrums. 

Much like aged wines, these characteristics can be impossibly complex for the human tongue to taste, much less verbalise on what these sensations, flavours, feelings could possibly be.

Indeed, my observations on decision makers in high-level situations who make good, bad; black or gray decisions have led me to consider the inevitability of successful, intuitive thinkers corrobating with good leaders. 

It is the reason why people can be paid obsecene amounts of money for the "equivalent" hours spent in the same industry. It is these judgement calls and gut feelings that drive timely but impactful thinking.

And rare is it for one individual to have all the information nor be in the right situation to define and decide on a "logical" response.

It is what sets us apart from animals and may perhaps continue to set us apart in the imminent age of AI. It will be interesting if the role of intuition would have a diminishing purpose - as technology ekes closer towards a replication of the human mind and the holy grail of general AI.

Of course, I speak to, and idolise strong intuitive thinkers - I've yet to really come across someone senior with bad intuition
