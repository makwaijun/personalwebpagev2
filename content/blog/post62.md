### Preamble: Background homework - Individual beliefs and values

As a massive, hugeee prerequsite to thinking about how we feel about work must be developing an understanding and appreciation of our own worldviews.  (instrospective mUcH?). It starts with aligning our definition of purpose with the actions we take (like work) must sense of life's ideology and what we deem to be more meaningful than others. Perhaps the thinking here may be thought-provoking - but never prescriptive.

In this respect, I draw a lot of my definition of purpose from my prior thinking (as documented in my previous posts) around understanding [Sustainability](https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post28/) and the [Economy](https://www.makwaijun.com/post35/). These will feature in the stream of conciousness that I am about to detail below. Indulgently, I shall describe these as various Tenets - the core mental model and fundamental beliefs when I look at the intersection of purpose and work. 

### Tenet 1: Mission Driven - WTWRNRN
At the very core of it all, I follow a philosophy that is built around having my labour and time on earth contribute positively to society and the world at large. A higher calling, some call it. Service before self.  

As such, I very much subscribe to the the integration of work and values/life. To spend many of our days and years in this world, I find is better spent either finding answers or answering the question: "What (does) the world really need right now". Thereafter known here as WTWRNRN.

A common term and filter I use is "Mission-driven" - to describe people and organisations of similar inclinations. That being said, I find it increasingly common that companies are defining or redefining their missions and contributions to the world. No longer can the corporate machines be purely and proudly proccupied with profit. Some companies I believe have, and will continue to provide immense benefits to the world; others, I am cynically skeptical of such defintions as an exercise in branding to their stakeholders and employees. 

### Tenet 2: Non-Bullshit Jobs

As expressed in my prior [posts](https://www.makwaijun.com/blog/post42/), the shift to intangible areas of the economy has led to a rise of numerous jobs that I reckon do not (or worse-still, oppose), the golden question WTWRNRN. I broadly, and perhaps unfairly smear a swathe of industries: Tech, financial services, trading, compliance, syncophants and marketing. To be clear, while I appreciate the importance and its benefits, fundamentally I find these sectors to be too easily bastardised into bullshit; led astray by the avarice of human nature. 

In the context of the burgeoning Sustainability sector, I see a lot of talk about a new wave of green jobs. While great - for sure - I find that the majority of it will flow into roles such as i) Sustainability "Strategy" or ii) audit/ compliance types of jobs. On the former, strategising to defned an existing business against compliance could, in long term, slow down progress - I have a pessimistic view of organisations' ability to pivot radically and meaningfully e.g. sustainability in fast fashion, must surely be a echo chamber slathering greenwashed paint on their brands. On the latter, audit is certainly important - we can't fix what we don't know. But I would lament that those aspiring for more should spend their effort elsewhere, compared to navigiating entrenched organisational politics, and the tedium of Carbon $ accounting. 

Is it not known that the environmental industry is grounded in dealing with the water in your taps? The food on your table? The literal shit /waste created? The lights that turn on like magic? I maintain that the real grit and hands on work by those who sit one level too high above it, are the most ill-informed to make decisions, or espouse their passions for sustainability. 

How it is that more white collar office jobs in green audit are created over green technicians escapes me.  (Rant over)

Functionally - I also aspire to be as close to the action as possible. To be in positions that can minimise bureacracy, and tackle first hand the challenges and struggles of running a good business. 

### Tenet 3: Feasibility in the System

If being Mission-Driven and non- bullshit work is the be-all, end-all, surely non-profits could be the pinnacle having a purposeful work? Possibly for some, but I have felt an urge to consider the fallibilities of non-financially driven companies. (disclosure: I have worked in government, but not a non-profit before). 

Be they non-profits, NGOs, or government roles on the other hand are similarly mission driven. These however, tend to be corruptable by human nature. With the lack of an objective benchmark - a competition in empathy, marketing-advocacy and serving political needs will eventually dictate day to day operations of such places - no matter how well-intentioned the mission may be. 

Anecdotally, I have heard that Non-profits are not the best place to work...and I cannot help but imagine an ultra defensive, insecure leadership in lesser organisations. Perhaps their people were drawn into the sector by being a contrarian / a rebel, wade through the toxicity through pure angst, and later claiming moral superiority. Such places would be hard to work in. That said, it's not as if i completely rule such areas out in my mind - b

As such, I view real world impact running at real world speeds are better effected through competition in the open markets within the confines of our economic system. It ain't perfect, but simply being too disruptive or rebellious against the system will only create a community of angry outcasts rather than agents of change. Similarly, I see financial viability and economic feasibility and a core tenet and proxy for excellence, impact and success. 

The real world is not a charity, and dreams of change should not be subsidised by the emotional tugging of a rich man's (/woman, its 2022) purse strings. 

### Tenet 4: Growth and Learning

Lastly, is the contiuinal belief in the general human capacity to learn, encapsulated in the phrase "Life-long learning". I can, I am able, and I should continue to learn, even if that means being in an uncomfortable position. That's it really.

### My interpretation: Staying true to purpose

In my current state, gratefully with a major lack of liabilities - I can continue to pursue something that contributes to something above oneself (and without the bullshittery of, by having something directly relevant); and not pushing papers or money. I have been privleged enough to have options and choices within my control. 

These Tenets have led me to three three main areas:
1) Sustainability - as a result of bieng I) Mission-Driven and III) increasingly economically "hot". Also I had studied it at university, and it'd be a shame not to make use of it;
2) Hardware products - as a result of II), and my personal beliefs in tangible technology for tangible outcomes. 
3) Start up - as a result of being in the uncomofrtable role of II) Front line non bullshit action, and accelerating growth in IV) Learning.

It is a 3-criteria checkbox, that has guided me in this phase of my career and life.

But staying true to this guiding pole will always be challenged by the what-ifs, and grass-is-greener devils on one's shoulder. In an age where patience is a rare and precious virtue, the sixth primal sin of invidious envy will be an ever omnipresent distraction starting at me from my screen. And so, I look to these tenets to help me remember and remain attuned to what I find most purposeful.

To end with a little soothing prose for my own well-being:

For accepting my pangs of jealousy; as I traverse a garden of verdant envy
within which lie the vainglories of distasteful snakes (whom are not WTWRNRN);
To instead embrace admiration and inspiration, as I stand resolute in defining the right notions of success;
To endure the inevitable tribulations for physical, mental and spiritual growth;
To be true to oneself, while equally open to the
different perspectives of the good natured characters I meet on this journey - 
I shall stay the course in the pursuit of purpose

...


Philosophical indulgences aside, the real-life practicalities (like uh..a livelihood) - of course, will be discussed in following posts.
