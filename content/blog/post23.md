#### TLDR;

- Mazlowe described a framework of human needs. There are things that are tangible and essential, just as there are things that are intangible and non-essential     (self-fulfilment/ transcendence). 
- As marketing becomes the key     differentiator in a world where material functionality is commoditised, there is a real risk of pervasive bullshit (I am yet to read a [seminal piece](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466958-bullshit-jobs) on this). 
- Yet, in the pursuit of growth, capital will continue to flow to such areas. This I term, is the  rise of the "Nonsense Economy". It is the new frontier of rent-seeking behaviour.
