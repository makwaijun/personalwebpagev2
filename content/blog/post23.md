#### TLDR;

- Mazlowe described a framework of human needs. There are things that are tangible and essential, just as there are things that are intangible and non-essential     (self-fulfilment/ transcendence). 
- As marketing becomes the key     differentiator in a world where material functionality is commoditised, there is a real risk of pervasive bullshit (I am yet to read a [seminal piece](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466958-bullshit-jobs) on this). 
- Yet, in the pursuit of growth, capital will continue to flow to such areas. This I term, is the  rise of the "Nonsense Economy". It is the new frontier of rent-seeking behaviour.

#### Recognising the Strengths of the Current System

It is important to recognise that the series of essays is not meant to take a shit on the current system. 

Our system is built for innovation. And has done so very well. But this system is very poor at allocation. We have all the tools we need to create a good standard of living. 



#### The shifting Sands

The Storytelling Premia, and the laggard engineer.

How many modern day workers truly know where their food comes from? where their energy comes from? how their fundamental basic needs are met?

Just as industries and companies climb up the value chain, so is the rich economy following mazlowe's hierachy.

#### The Dterminants of the future economy

For the future economy; key determinants - minimum scale threshold (for things to be competitor edge. Such that there are benefits) 

 Middle class - materialism and luxurism. 

You need a pump by profit or pump by cheap debt. This flows the economy.
