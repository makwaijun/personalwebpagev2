And off that last post on Children, I dug up yet another related post in the backlog. 

This serves a partial book review on David Brook's the Road to Character. 

*Afternote, gosh I've read it a time along since actually posting this. *

### On Character
As remarked in the previous post on education (Link here) I see the need to manage ourselves well (Life-led) as equally important to academics. This is something that cannot be directly "taught" in a school, but I believe it to be critically important as the world becomes ever more complex, uncertain and complicated.

As an extension of this line of thinking, I (not recently) read a book about character, which is a nice word to encapsulate all the relevant terms related to this topic: Call it integrity, values, self-mastery, discipline. 

But in general (and indeed, the premise of the book), every "great" individual goes through journey, often with a non-lethal measure of hardship, shaping them into the mold of renown and "greatness", though flawed in their own ways for sure.

But I am of the similar view that for every individuals rise to greatness - for no one will write about - there are just as many, or perhaps far more that struggle with the very real human tedency to slide into matters of deprivation, self destruction and akrasia. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia]  . To be clear, this is not an encouragement nor a worldview where I believe that __everyone__ should aspire to "greatness". [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory ], but rather an observation on what might have be done right that we mortals could learn from. 


*Crap my previous coherent draft ends here.*

So, given that the book very much reflects on the growth of morality and meaning in a purposeful life, I have parked this as an interim post on education, in the context of how people can be enabled to achieve this in a non-lethal manner without too terrible a hardship. 

Some related mental models I had penned down here:

* The Adam I vs Adam II concept on our primal instincts vs a logical one. My view is that both must be groomed well
* That tough times build tough people, and we must fight the overbearing protective instinct to inculcate the necessary trade-offs for thoughtful development.
* Surrounded by good influences
* Succession cannot be done alone. Perhaps its a mixture of personal (Adam I, emotional) investment, together with a rational, objective structure (Adam 2)


#### On Succession:
In my earlier notes, I had contemplated the mysetery of Succcession of Marcus Aurelius. For great a philosopher king as he - was he not able to groom a successor well? 

It is here that I the real considerations of:
*  Whether character can be taught - though the answer somewhere here lies in between a tough time and reflection
*  Trading-off with wanting the best for a loved ones
*  Trading-off with wanting the said loved one to like us as individuals (we're all softies aren't we)
*  How much and how close we take after our parents?
