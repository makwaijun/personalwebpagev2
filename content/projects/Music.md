After being coerced into music lessons for the better part of my childhood years - I was glad to have found something of a musical spark post-highschool. Unfettered from laborious exams and the pretentious contemporary pieces, I was keen on playing music that I wanted to.

Fairly basic and amateur-ish, but nonetheless a passion I enjoy and would love to have more time invested into.

## Gear
Most videos were recorded with a [Blue Yeti](https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti/) Microphone and [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/). I first used these more than a decade ago - and they still work well even today.
